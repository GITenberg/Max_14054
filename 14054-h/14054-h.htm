<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">A NIGHT journey is essentially a thing of
possibilities. To those who count it as mere transit, mere linking
of experiences, it is, of course, a commonplace; but to the
imaginative, who by gift divine see a picture in every cloud, a
story behind every shadow, it suggests romance&mdash;romance in the
very making.</div>
<p>Such a vessel of inspiration was the powerful north express as
it thundered over the sleeping plains of Germany and France on its
night journey from Cologne to Paris. A thing of possibilities
indeed, with its varying human freight&mdash;stolid Teutons,
hard-headed Scandinavians, Slavs whom expediency or caprice had
forced to descend upon Paris across the sea of ice. It was the
month of January, and an unlikely and unlovely night for long and
arduous travel. There were few pleasure-passengers on the express,
and if one could have looked through the carriage windows, blurred
with damp mist, one would have seen upon almost every face the
look&mdash;resigned or resolute&mdash;of those who fare forth by
necessity rather than by choice. In the sleeping-cars all the
berths were occupied, but here and them throughout the length of
the train an occasional traveller slept on the seat of his
carriage, wrapped in coats and rugs, while in the dining-saloon a
couple of sleepy waiters lurched to and fro in attendance upon a
party of three men whose energy precluded the thought of wasting
even the night hours and who were playing cards at one of the small
tables. Up and down the whole overheated, swaying train there was
the suggestion of mystery, of contrast and effect, and the
twinkling eyes of the electric lamps seemed to wink from behind
their drawn hoods as though they, worldly wise and watchful, saw
the individuality&mdash;the inevitable story&mdash;behind the
drowsy units who sat or lay or lounged unguarded beneath them.</p>
<p>In one carriage, the fifth or sixth from the thundering engine,
these lights winked and even laughed one to the other each time the
train lurched over the points, and the dark, shrouding hoods
quivered, allowing a glimpse at the occupant of the
compartment.</p>
<p>It was the figure of a boy upon which the twinkling lamp-eyes
flickered&mdash;a boy who had as yet scarce passed the barrier of
manhood, for the skin of the face was clean and smooth, and the
limbs, seen vaguely under a rough overcoat, had the freedom and
supple grace that belongs to early youth.</p>
<p>He was sleeping, this solitary traveller&mdash;one hand under
his head, the other instinctively guarding something that lay deep
and snug in the pocket of his overcoat. His attitude was relaxed,
but not entirely abandoned to the solace of repose; even in his
sleep a something of self-consciousness seemed to cling to
him&mdash;a need for caution that lay near to the surface of his
drowsing senses&mdash;for once or twice he started, once or twice
his straight, dark eyebrows twitched into a frown, once or twice
his fingers tightened nervously upon their treasure. He was
subconsciously aware that, deserted though the compartment was, it
yet exhaled an alien suggestion, embodied in the rugs, the coats,
the hand-baggage of the card-playing travellers, which was heaped
upon the seat opposite.</p>
<p>But, despite this physical uneasiness, he was dreaming as the
train tore along through the damp, peaceful country&mdash;dreaming
with that odd confusion of time and scene that follows upon keen
excitement, stress of feeling or stress of circumstance.</p>
<p>As he dreamed, he was standing again in the outer court of a
house in Petersburg&mdash;a house to which he was debtor for one
night's shelter; it was early morning and deadly cold. The whole
picture was sharp as a cut crystal&mdash;the triple court-yard, the
stone pavement, the gray well, and frozen pile of firewood. He saw,
recognized, lost it, and knew himself to be skimming down the
Nevskiy Prospekt and across the Winter Palace Square, where the
great angel towers upon its rose-granite monument. Forward, forward
he was carried, along the bank of the frozen Neva and over the
Troitskiy bridge, the powdered snow stinging his face like
pinpoints as it flew up from the nails in his little horse's shoes.
Then followed a magnifying of the picture&mdash;massed buildings
rising from the snow&mdash;buildings gold and turquoise-domed,
that, even as they materialized, lost splendor and merged into the
unpretentious frontage of the Finland station.</p>
<p>The scroll of the dream unwound; the dreamer moved, easing his
position, shaking back a lock of dark hair that had fallen across
his forehead. He was no longer rocking to the power of the north
express; he was standing on the platform at the end of a little
train that puffed out of the Finland station&mdash;a primitive,
miniature train, white with frost and powdered with the ashes of
its wood fuel. The vision came and passed a sketch, not a
picture&mdash;a suggestion of straight tracks, wide snow plains,
and the blue, misty blur of fir woods. Then a shifting, a juggling
of effects! &Aring;bo, the Finnish port, painted itself upon his
imagination, and he was embarked upon the lonely sledge-drive, to
the harbor. He started in his sleep, shivered and sighed at that
remembered drive. The train passed over new points, the hoods of
the lamps swayed, the lights blinked and winked, and his mind swung
onward in response to the physical jar.</p>
<p>&Aring;bo was obliterated. He was on board a ship&mdash;a ship
ploughing her way through the ice-fields as she neared Stockholm;
salt sea air flicked his nostrils, he heard the broken ice tearing
the keel like a million files, he was sensible of the crucial
sensation&mdash;the tremendous quiver&mdash;as the vessel slipped
from her bondage into the cradle of the sea, a sentient thing
welcoming her own element!</p>
<p>The heart of the dreamer leaped to that strange sensation. He
drew a long, sharp breath, and sat up, suddenly awake. It was over
and done with&mdash;the coldness, the rigor, the region of ice
bonds! The fingers of the future beckoned to him; the promises of
the future lapped his ears as the waves had lapped the ship's
sides.</p>
<p>He looked about him, at first excitedly, then confusedly, then a
little shamedfacedly, for we are always involuntarily shamed at
being tricked by our emotions into a false conception. Drawing his
hand from his coat-pocket, he stretched himself with an assumption
of ease, as though he saw and recognized the twinkle in the
electric lamps and spontaneously rose to its demands.</p>
<p>The train was flying forward at unabated speed. Outside, the raw
January air was clinging in a film to the carriage window; inside,
the dim light and overheated air made an artificial atmosphere,
enervating or stimulating according to the traveller's gifts. To
this solitary voyager stimulation was obviously the effect
produced, for, try as he might to cheat the inquisitive lamps,
interest in every detail of his surroundings was portrayed in his
face, in the poise of his head, the quickness of his glance as he
gazed round the compartment, verifying the impression that he was
alone.</p>

<h5>"STANDING AGAIN IN THE OUTER COURT OF A HOUSE IN
PETERSBURG"</h5>
<p>Yes, he was absolutely alone! Everything was as it had been when
he settled himself to sleep on the departure of the three
strangers. There, on the opposite seat, were their rugs, their
fur-lined coats, their illustrated papers&mdash;all the impedimenta
of prosperous travellers; and there, on the rack above them, was
his own modest hand-bag without initials or label&mdash;a common
little bag that might have belonged to some poor Russian clerk or
held the possessions of some needy Polish student. The owner's
glance scanned and appraised it, then by suggestion fell to the
plain rough overcoat that covered him from his neck to the tops of
his high boots, and whose replica was to be seen any day in the
meaner streets of Petersburg or Moscow. Like the bag, it was a
little strange, a little incongruous in its comfortable
surroundings&mdash;a little savoring of mystery.</p>
<p>The traveller's pulses quickened, his being lifted to the
moment, for in his soul was the spark of adventure, in his eyes the
adventurous look&mdash;fearless, observant, questioning. In
composition, in expression and essence, this boy was that free and
fascinating creature, the born adventurer&mdash;high of courage,
prodigal of emotion, capturer of the world's loot.</p>
<p>The spirit within him shone out in the moment of solitude; he
passed his hands down the front, of his coat, revelling in its
coarse texture; he rose to his feet, turned to the sheet of gray,
misted glass, and, letting down the window, leaned out into the
night.</p>
<p>The scene was vague and ghostly, but to eyes accustomed to
northern whiteness it was full of suggestion, full of secrecy; to
nostrils accustomed to keen, rarefied air there was something
poignant and delicious in the scent of turned earth, the savor of
vegetation. He could see little or nothing as the train rocked and
the landscape tore past, but the atmosphere spoke to him as it
speaks to blind men, penetrating his consciousness. Here were open
spaces, tracts of country fructifying for the spring to come. A
land of promise&mdash;of growth&mdash;of fulfilment!</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, living in the suggestion, and his spirit
sped forward with the onrush of the train. Somewhere beyond the
darkness lay the land of his desires! Somewhere behind the veil
shone the lights of Paris! With a quick, exulting excitement he
laughed; but even as the laugh was caught and scattered to the
winds by the thunder of the engine, his bearing changed, the
excitement dropped from him, a mask of immobility fell upon his
face, and he wheeled round from the window. The card-playing
travellers had opened the door of the carriage.</p>
<p>From his shadowy corner the boy eyed them; and they, alert from
their game, slightly dazed by the darkness of the carriage, peered
back at him, frankly curious. When they had left the compartment he
had been a huddled figure demanding no attention; now he was awake
and an individual, and human nature prompted interest.</p>
<p>Each in turn looked at him, and at each new glance his coldness
of demeanor deepened; until, as the eldest of the party came down
the carriage and appropriated the seat beside him, he turned away,
pulling up the window with resentful haste.</p>
<p>"Don't do that!" said the third man, pausing in the doorway and
speaking in French easily and pleasantly. "Don't do that&mdash;if
you want the air!"</p>
<p>The boy started and looked round.</p>
<p>"I thank you! But I do not need the air!"</p>
<p>The man smiled acquiescence, but as he stepped into the carriage
he took a sharp look at the boy's clothes&mdash;the common Russian
clothes&mdash;and a slightly questioning, slightly satirical
expression crossed his face. He was a man who knew his world the
globe over, and in his bearing lurked the toleration, the kindly
scepticism that such knowledge breeds.</p>
<p>"As you please!" he said, settling himself comfortably in the
corner by the door, while the elder of his companions&mdash;a tall,
spare American&mdash;crossed his long legs and lighted a thin black
cigar, and the younger&mdash;a spruce young Englishman wearing an
eye-glass and a small mustache&mdash;wrapped himself in his rugs,
took a clean pocket-handkerchief from his dressing-case, and opened
a large bundle of illustrated papers&mdash;French, German, and
English.</p>
<p>For a space the train rocked on. No one attempted to speak, and
the Russian boy continued to stand by the window, pretending to
look through the blurred panes, in reality wondering how he could
with least commotion pass down the carriage to his own vacated
place.</p>
<p>At last the man with the long cigar broke the silence in a slow,
cool voice that betrayed his nationality.</p>
<p>"We're well on time, Blake," he remarked, drawing out his
watch.</p>
<p>The youth by the window shot an involuntary, fleeting glance at
the two younger men, to see which would answer to the name; and the
student of human nature noted the fact that he understood
English.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's a good service!" he acquiesced, the tolerant
look&mdash;half sceptical, half humorous&mdash;- passing again over
his face.</p>
<p>"I don't know! I think we could do with another few kilometres
to the hour." The thin man studied his flat gold watch with the
loving interest of one to whom time is a sacred thing.</p>
<p>At this point the youngest of the three raised his head.</p>
<p>"Marvellous sight you have, McCutcheon! Wish I could see by this
light!"</p>
<p>McCutcheon leaned forward, replacing his watch. "What! Can't you
see your picture-books? Let's have the blinkers off!" He rose, his
long, spidery figure stretching up like a grotesque shadow, but as
his arm went out to the nearest of the shrouded lamps he was
compelled to draw back against the seat of the carriage, and an
exclamation of surprise escaped him.</p>
<p>Without warning or apology the Russian boy had turned from the
window, and stepping down the carriage, had tumbled into his former
seat, hunching himself up with his face to the cushions and his
back to his fellow-travellers.</p>
<p>It was a sudden and an uncivil proceeding. The man called Blake
smiled; the Englishman shrugged his shoulders; the American, with a
movement of quiet determination, drew back the lamp hoods.</p>
<p>In the flood of light the carriage lost its air of mystery, and
Blake, who had a fancy for the mysterious, dropped back into his
corner and took out his cigar-case with a little feeling of regret.
In traversing the world's pathways, beaten or wild, he always made
a point of seeing the story behind the circumstance; and, had he
realized it, a common instinct bound him in a triangular link to
the peering, winking lamps, and to the Russian boy lying unsociably
wrapped in his heavy coat. All three had an eye for an
adventure.</p>
<p>But the lights were up, and the curtain down&mdash;it was a
theatre between the acts; and presently the calculating voice of
McCutcheon broke forth again, as he relapsed into his original
attitude, coiling up his long limbs and nursing his cigar to a
glow.</p>
<p>"I can't get over that 'four jacks,'" he said. "To think I could
have been funked into seeing Billy at fifty!"</p>
<p>Blake laughed. "'Twas the eye-glass did it, Mac! A man shouldn't
be allowed to play poker with an eye-glass; it's taking an undue
advantage."</p>
<p>McCutcheon smiled his dry smile and shot a quizzical glance at
the neat young Englishman, who had become absorbed in one of his
papers.</p>
<p>"Solid face, Blake!" he agreed. "Nothing so fine as an eye-glass
for sheer bluff. What would Billy be without one? Well, perhaps we
won't say. But with it you have no use for doubt&mdash;he's a
diplomat all the time."</p>
<p>The young man named Billy showed no irritation. With the
composure which he wore as a garment, he went on with his
occupation.</p>
<p>For a time McCutcheon bore this aloofness, then he opened a new
attack. "What are you reading, my son? Makes a man sort of want his
breakfast to see that hungry look in your eyes. Share the
provender, won't you?"</p>
<p>Billy looked up sedately.</p>
<p>"You fellows think my life's a game," he said. "But I tell you
it takes some doing to keep in touch with things."</p>
<p>Blake laughed chaffingly. "And the illustrated weekly papers are
an excellent substitute for Blue-books?"</p>
<p>Billy remained undisturbed. "It's all very well to scoff, but
one may get a side-light anywhere. In diplomacy nothing's too
insignificant to notice."</p>
<p>Again Blake laughed. "The principle on which it offers you a
living?"</p>
<p>"Oh, come," said Billy, "that's rather rough! You know very well
what I mean. 'Tisn't always in the serious reports you get the
color of a fact, just as the gossip of a dinner-table is often more
enlightening than a cabinet council."</p>
<p>"Apropos?"</p>
<p>"I was thinking of this Petersburg affair."</p>
<p>"What? The everlasting Duma business?" McCutcheon drew in a long
breath of smoke.</p>
<p>Billy looked superior, as befitted a man who dealt in subtler
matters than mere politics. "Not at all," he said. "The
disappearance of the Princess Davorska."</p>
<p>Here Blake made a murmur of impatience. "Oh, Billy, don't!" he
said. "It's so frightfully banal."</p>
<p>McCutcheon took his cigar from his mouth. "The woman who
disappeared on the eve of her marriage?"</p>
<p>"Yes," broke in Blake, "disappeared on the eve of her marriage
to elope with some poet or painter, and set society by the ears.
Thoroughly modern and banal!"</p>
<p>The young diplomat glanced up once more.</p>
<p>"I don't think there's any suggestion of a lover."</p>
<p>"Fact is more potent than suggestion, Billy. Of course there is
a lover. Princesses don't disappear alone."</p>
<p>"You're a Socialist, Ned." Billy's eyes returned to his paper.
"Like all good Socialists, crammed to the neck with class bigotry.
Nobody is such an individualist as the man who advocates
equality!"</p>
<p>Blake smiled. "That seems to sound all right," he said; "but it
doesn't remove the lover."</p>
<p>The good-humored scepticism at last forced a way to Billy's
susceptibilities.</p>
<p>"Look here," he said, crossly, "if hearing's not believing,
perhaps seeing is! Look at these pictures; they're not particularly
modern or banal."</p>
<p>He held out his paper, but Blake shook his head.</p>
<p>"No! No, Billy, not for me. If it was some little Rumanian gypsy
who had run away from her tribe I'd take her to my heart and
welcome. But a Princess Davorska&mdash;no!"</p>
<p>At this point McCutcheon stretched out his long arm and took the
paper from Billy's hand. "Let's have a squint!" he said. "Lover or
no lover, she must be a bit wide awake." And, curling himself up
again, he began to read from the paper, in a monotonous murmuring
voice: "'<i>The Princess, as well as being a woman of artistic
accomplishments, is an ardent sportswoman, having in her early
girlhood hunted and shot with keen zest on her father's estates.
The above picture shows her at the age of seventeen, carrying a
gun</i>.' By the Lord, she is wide awake!" he added, by way of
comment. "She is wide awake carrying that gun, but I'd lay my money
on the second picture. Say, Billy, she looks a queen in her court
finery!"</p>
<p>But here real disgust crossed Blake's face. "Oh, that'll do,
Mac! Give us peace about the woman. I'm sick to death of all such
nonsense. We're due in a couple of hours. I think I'll try for
forty winks." He threw away his cigar and tucked his rug about
him.</p>
<p>McCutcheon glanced at him, and, seeing that he was in earnest,
handed the paper back to Billy.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Mac!" Blake murmured. "Sorry if I was a bear! Don't
switch off the light, it won't bother me." He nodded, smiled, drew
his rug closer about his knees, and settled himself to sleep with
the ease of the accustomed traveller.</p>
<p>For close upon an hour complete silence reigned in the heated
carriage. Blake slept silently and peacefully; Billy went
methodically through his papers, dropping them one by one at his
feet as he finished with them; McCutcheon smoked, gazing into space
with the blank expression of the strenuous man who has learned to
utilize his momentary respites; while, stretched along the cushions
of the carriage, his face hidden, his eyes wide open and attentive,
lay the young Russian, his fingers tentatively caressing the
treasure in the pocket of his coat.</p>
<p>But at last the spell was broken. The diplomatic Englishman
dropped his last paper, and McCutcheon stretched himself and looked
once more at his watch.</p>
<p>"Paris in an hour, Billy! Didn't those loafers in the dining-car
promise us coffee somewhat about this time?"</p>
<p>Billy looked up, unruffled of mind and body as in the first
moment of the journey. "I believe they did," he said. "Tell you
what! You jog their memories, while I go and wash. What about
calling Ned?"</p>
<p>At sound of his own name, Blake's eyes opened. His waking was
characteristic of him. It was no slow recovery of the senses; he
was asleep and then awake&mdash;fully, easily awake, with a
complete consciousness of his position&mdash;a complete, assured
grasp of time and place.</p>
<p>"We're getting on, eh?" he said. "I suppose you're going to tub
before those fat Belgians in the sleeping-car, Billy? If you are,
keep a second place for me, like a good boy. There's nothing more
fiendishly triumphant than taking a bath in the basin while the
rest of the train is rattling the door-handle. Don't forget! Second
place!" Then he turned to the American. "What about the coffee,
Mac? I expect those poor devils of waiters have slept your order
off."</p>
<p>"I was just about to negotiate that coffee transaction."
McCutcheon stood up. "You come too, my son! A little exercise will
give you an appetite." He paused to stretch his long, lean body,
and incidentally his glance fell upon their travelling companion,
and he indicated the recumbent figure with a jerk of the head.</p>
<p>"Say, Ned, ought we to wake our unsociable friend?" Blake cast
one quick glance at the huddled form, then he answered, tersely:
"Let him alone! He's not asleep&mdash;and, anyway, he understands
English."</p>
<p>At which McCutcheon made a comprehending grimace, and the two
left the carriage.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>For many minutes the young Russian did not move; then, when
positive certainty of his solitude had grown into his mind, he
lifted himself on one elbow and looked cautiously about him.</p>
<p>A change had passed over his face in the last hour&mdash;an
interesting change. The smooth cheek that the night air had cooled
to paleness was now flushed, and there was a spark of anger in the
bright eyes. Unquestionably this boy had a temper and a spirit of
his own, and both had been aroused. There was a certain arrogance,
a certain contempt in his glance now as it swept the inoffensive
coats and rugs of the departed travellers, a certain antagonism as
he sat up, tossed back the lock of hair that had again fallen
across his forehead, and turned his eyes to the heap of papers
lying upon the carriage floor.</p>
<p>For long he gazed upon these papers, as though they exercised a
magnetic influence, and at last, with a swift impulse, extremely
characteristic, he stretched out his arm and drew forth the lowest
of the heap.</p>
<p>He regained his former position with a quick, lithe movement of
the body, and in an instant he was poring over the paper, the pages
turning with incredible speed under the eagerness of his touch. At
last he reached the page he sought, the page that had offered
ground for discussion to the three voyagers an hour earlier.</p>
<p>His eyes flashed, his fingers tightened, his dark head was bent
lower over the paper. Two pictures confronted him. The first was of
a woman in Russian court dress, who wore her jewels and her
splendor of apparel with an air of pride and careless supremacy
that had in it something magnificent, something semi-barbaric. The
boy looked at this curious and arresting picture, but only for a
moment; by some affinity, some subtle attraction, his eyes turned
instantly to the second portrait&mdash;the girl carrying the
gun&mdash;and as if in answer to some secret sympathy, some silent
comprehension, the frown upon his brows relaxed and his lips
parted.</p>
<p>It was still the woman of the jewels and the splendid apparel,
but it was a woman infinitely free, infinitely unhampered. The
plain, serviceable clothes fitted the slight figure as though they
had been long worn and loved; the hair was closely coiled, so that
the young face looked out upon the world frank and unadorned as a
boy's. Here, as in the first picture, the eyes looked forth with a
curious, proud directness; but beneath the directness was a glint
of humor, a flash of daring absent in the other face; the mouth
smiled, seeming to anticipate life's secrets, the ungloved hand
held the gun with a touch peculiarly caressing, peculiarly
firm.</p>
<p>The traveller looked, looked again, and then, with a
deliberation odd in so slight a circumstance, folded the paper,
rose, and stepped to the window of the carriage.</p>
<p>The night mist beat in, still raw and cold, but somewhere behind
the darkness was the stirring, the vague presage of the day to
come. He leaned out, fingers close about the paper, lips and
nostrils breathing in the suggestive, vaporous air. For a moment he
stood, steadying himself to the motion of the train, palpitating to
his secret thoughts; then, with a little theatricality all for his
own edification, he opened his fingers and, freeing the paper,
watched it swirl away, hang for a second like a moth against the
lighted window, and vanish into the night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">'JOURNEYS end in lovers' meeting.' The phrase
conjures a picture. The court-yard of some inn, glowing ripe in the
tints of the setting sun&mdash;open doors&mdash;an ancient coach
disgorging its passengers! This&mdash;or, perhaps, some quay alive
with sound and movement&mdash;cries of command in varying
tongues&mdash;crowded gangways&mdash;rigging massed against the
sky&mdash;all the paraphernalia of romance and travel. But the real
journey&mdash;the journey of adventure itself&mdash;is frequently
another matter: often gray, often loverless, often demanding from
the secret soul of the adventurer spirit and inspiration, lest the
blood turn cold in sick dismay, and the brain cloud under its
weight of nostalgia.</div>
<p>Paris in the dawn of a wet day is a sorry sight; the Gare du
Nord in the hours of early morning is a place of infinite gloom. As
the north express thundered into its recesses, waking strange and
hollow echoes, the long sweep of the platform brought a shudder to
more than one tired mind. A string of sleepy porters&mdash;gray
silhouettes against a gray background&mdash;was the only sign of
life. Colors there were none, lovers there were none, Parisian joy
of living there was not one vestige.</p>
<p>Paris! The murmur crept through the train, stirring the weariest
to mechanical action. Paris! Heads were thrust through the windows,
wraps and hand-bags passed out to the shadowy, mysterious porters
who received them in a silence born of the godless hour and the
penetrating, chilling dampness of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the carriage fifth or sixth from the engine the three
fellow-travellers greeted the arrival in the orthodox way. The tall
American stretched his long limbs and groaned wearily as he got his
belongings together, while the dapper young Englishman thrust his
head out of the window and withdrew it as rapidly.</p>
<p>"Beastly morning!" he announced. "Paris on a wet day is like a
woman with draggled skirts."</p>
<p>"Get rid of our belongings first, Billy, make epigrams after!"
The man called Blake pushed him quietly aside and, stepping to the
window, dropped a leather bag into the hands of a porter.</p>
<p>Of the three, his manner was the most indifferent, his temper
the most unruffled; and of the three, he alone remembered the
fourth occupant of the carriage, for, being relieved of his bag, he
turned with his hand still upon the window, and his eyes sought the
youthful figure drawn with lonely isolation into its corner.</p>
<p>"Do you want a porter?" he asked.</p>
<p>The question was unexpected. The boy started and sat straighter
in his seat. For one moment he seemed to sway between two impulses,
then, with a new determination, he looked straight at his
questioner with his clear eyes.</p>
<p>"No," he said, speaking slowly and with a grave deliberation, "I
do not need a porter. I have no luggage&mdash;but this." He rose,
as if to prove the truth of his declaration, and lifted his valise
from the rack.</p>
<p>It was a simple movement, simple as the question and answer that
had preceded it, but it held interest for Blake. He could not have
analyzed the impression, but something in the boy's air touched
him, something in the young figure so plainly clad, so aloof, stood
out with sharp appeal in the grayness and unreality of the dawn. A
feeling that was neither curiosity nor pity, and yet savored of
both, urged him to further speech. As his two companions, anxious
to be free of the train, passed out into the corridor, he glanced
once more at the slight figure, at the high Russian boots, the long
overcoat, the fur cap drawn down over the dark hair.</p>
<p>"Look here! you aren't alone in Paris?" he asked in the easy,
impersonal way that spoke his nationality. "You have
people&mdash;friends to meet you?"</p>
<p>For an instant the look that had possessed the boy's face during
the journey&mdash;the look of suspicion akin to fear&mdash;leaped
up, but on the moment it was conquered. The well-poised head was
thrown back, and again the eyes met Blake's in a deliberate
gaze.</p>
<p>"Why do you ask, monsieur?"</p>
<p>The words were clipped, the tone proud and a little cold.</p>
<p>Another man might have hesitated to reply truthfully, but Blake
was an Irishman and used to self-expression.</p>
<p>"I ask," he said, simply, "because you are so young."</p>
<p>A new expression&mdash;a new daring&mdash;swept the boy's mobile
face. A spirit of raillery gleamed in his eyes, and he smiled for
the first time.</p>
<p>"How old, monsieur?"</p>
<p>The question, the smile touched Blake anew. He laughed
involuntarily with a sudden sense of friendliness.</p>
<p>"Sixteen?&mdash;seventeen?"</p>
<p>The boy, still smiling, shook his head.</p>
<p>"Guess again, monsieur."</p>
<p>Blake's interest flashed out. Here, in the gray station, in this
damp hour of dawn, he had touched something magnetic&mdash;some
force that drew and held him. A quality intangible and
indescribable seemed to emanate from this unknown boy, some strange
radiance of vitality that flooded his surroundings as with
sunshine.</p>
<p>"Eighteen, then!" He laughed once more, with a curious sense of
pleasure.</p>
<p>But from the corridor outside a slow voice was borne back on the
damp, close air, forbidding further parley.</p>
<p>"Blake! I say, Blake! For the Lord's sake, get a move on!"</p>
<p>The spell was broken, the moment of companionship passed. Blake
drifted toward the carriage door, the boy following.</p>
<p>Outside in the corridor they were sucked into the stream of
departing passengers&mdash;that odd medley of men and women,
unadorned, jaded, careless, that a night train disgorges. Slowly,
step by step, the procession made its way, each unit that composed
it glancing involuntarily into the empty carriages that he
passed&mdash;the carriages that, in their dimmed light, their
airlessness, their <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of papers, seemed to be a
reflection of his own exhausted condition; then a gust of chilly
air told of the outer world, and one by one the travellers slid
through the narrow doorway, each instinctively pausing to brace
himself against the biting cold before stepping down upon the
platform.</p>
<p>At last it was Blake's turn. He, too, paused; then he, too, took
the final plunge, shivered, glanced at where McCutcheon and the
Englishman were talking to their porters, then turned to watch the
Russian boy swing himself lithely down from the high step of the
train.</p>
<p>All about him was the consciousness of the awakening crowd,
conveyed by the jostling of elbows, the deepening hum of
voices.</p>
<p>"Look here!" he said again, in response to his original impulse.
"You have somebody to meet you?"</p>
<p>The boy glanced up, a secret emotion burning in his eyes. "No,
monsieur."</p>
<p>"You are quite alone?"</p>
<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>
<p>"And why are you here&mdash;to play or to work?"</p>
<p>The question was unwarrantable, but an Irishman can dispense
with warranty in a manner unknown to other men. It had ever been
Blake's way to ask what he desired to know.</p>
<p>This time no offence showed itself in the boy's face.</p>
<p>"In part to work, in part to play, monsieur," he answered,
gravely; "in part to learn life."</p>
<p>The reply was strange to Blake's ears&mdash;strange in its grave
sincerity, stranger still in its quiet fearlessness.</p>
<p>"But you are such a child!" he cried, impulsively.
"You&mdash;"</p>
<p>Imperceptibly the slight figure stiffened, the proud look
flashed again into the eyes.</p>
<p>"Many thanks, monsieur, but I am older than you think&mdash;and
very independent. I have the honor monsieur, to wish you
good-bye."</p>
<p>The tone was absolutely courteous, but it was final. He bowed
with easy foreign grace, raised his fur cap, and, turning, swung
down the platform and out of sight.</p>
<p>Blake stood watching him&mdash;watching until the high head, the
straight shoulders, the lithe, swinging body were but a memory;
then he turned with a start, as a hand was laid upon his shoulder,
and the pleasant, prosaic voice of the young Englishman assailed
his ears.</p>
<p>"My dear chap, what in the world are you doing? Not day-dreaming
with the mercury at thirty?"</p>
<p>"Foolish&mdash;but I was!" Blake answered, calmly. "I was
watching that young Russian stalk away into the unknown, and I was
wondering&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>He smiled a little cynically. "I was wondering, Billy, what type
of individual and what particular process fate will choose to let
him break himself upon."</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The most splendid moment of an adventure is not always the
moment of fulfilment, not even the moment of conception, but the
moment of first accomplishment, when the adventurer deliberately
sets his face toward the new road, knowing that his boats are
burned.</p>
<p>Nothing could have been less inspiring than the dreary Gare du
Nord, nothing less inviting than the glimpse of Paris to be caught
through its open doorways; but had the whole world laughed him a
welcome, the young Russian's step could not have been more elastic,
his courage higher, his heart more ready to pulse to the quick
march of his thoughts, as he strode down the gray platform and out
into the open.</p>
<p>In the open he paused to study his surroundings. As yet the full
tale of passengers had not emerged, and only an occasional
wayfarer, devoid of baggage as himself, had fared forth into the
gloom. Outside, the artificial light of the station ceased to do
battle with nature, and only an occasional street lamp gave
challenge to the gloomy dawn. The damp mist that all night had
enshrouded Paris still clung about the streets like ragged
grave-clothes, and at the edge of the pavement half a dozen
<i>fiacres</i> were ranged in a melancholy line, the wretched
horses dozing as they stood, the drivers huddled into their fur
capes and numbed by the clinging cold. Everywhere was darkness and
chill and the listless misery of a winter dawn, when vitality is at
its lowest ebb and the passions of man are sunk in lethargy.</p>
<p>Only a creature infinitely young could have held firm in face of
such dejection, only eyes as alert and wakeful as those of this
wayfaring boy could possibly have looked undaunted at the shabby
streets with their flaunting travesty of joy exhibited in the
dripping awnings of the deserted <i>caf&eacute;s</i>, that offered
<i>Bi&egrave;re, Billard</i>, and yet again <i>Bi&egrave;re</i> to
an impassive world.</p>
<p>But the eyes were wakeful, the soul of the adventurer was
infinitely young. He looked at it all with a certain steadfastness
that seemed to say, "Yes, I see you! You are hideous, slatternly,
unfriendly; but through all the disguise I recognize you. Through
the mask I trace the features&mdash;subtle, alluring, fascinating.
You are Paris! Paris!"</p>
<p>The idea quickened action as a draught of wine might quicken
thought; his hand involuntarily tightened upon his valise, his body
braced itself afresh, and, as if resigning himself finally to
chance, that deity loved of all true adventurers, he stepped from
the pavement into the greasy roadway.</p>
<p>Seeing him move, a loafer, crouching in the shadow of the
station, slunk reluctantly into the open and offered to procure him
a <i>fiacre</i>; but the boy's shake of the head was determined,
and, crossing the road, he turned to the left, gazing up with eager
interest at the many hotels that rub shoulders in that
uninteresting region.</p>
<p>One after the other he reviewed and rejected them, moving onward
with the excitement that is born of absolute uncertainty. Onward he
went, without pause, until the pavement was intersected by a
side-street, and peering up through the misty light he read the
legend, "rue de Dunkerque."</p>
<p>Rue de Dunkerque! It conveyed nothing to his mind. But was he
not seeking the unknown? Again his head went up, again his
shoulders stiffened, and, smiling to himself at some secret
thought, he swung round the corner and plunged into the
unexplored.</p>
<p>Half way down the rue de Dunkerque stands the H&ocirc;tel
Railleux. It is a tall and narrow house, somewhat dirty and
entirely undistinguished; there is nothing to recommend it save
perhaps an air of privacy, a certain insignificance that wedges it
between the surrounding buildings in a manner tempting to one
anxious to avoid his fellows.</p>
<p>This quality it was that caught the boy's attention. He paused
and studied the H&ocirc;tel Railleux with an attention that he had
denied to the large and common hostelries that front the station.
He looked at it long and meditatively, then very slowly and
thoughtfully he walked to the end of the street. At the end of the
street he turned, his mind made up, and, hurrying back, went
straight into the hall of the hotel as though thirsting to pledge
himself irrevocably to his decision.</p>
<p>It is impossible for the sensible individual to see romance in
this entry into a third-rate Parisian hotel&mdash;to see daring or
to see danger&mdash;but the boy's heart was beating fast as the
glass door swung behind him, and his tongue was dry as he stepped
into the little office on the right of the poor hall.</p>
<p>Here in the office the story of the streets was repeated. A
dingy gas-jet shed a faint light, as though reluctantly awake;
behind a small partition, half counter, half desk, a wan and
sleepy&mdash;looking man was cowering over a stove. As the boy
entered he looked up uncertainly, then he rose and smiled, for your
Parisian is exhausted indeed when he fails to conjure up a
smile.</p>
<p>"Good-day, monsieur!"</p>
<p>The words were a travesty in view of the miserable dawn, but the
boy took heart. There was greeting in the tone. He moistened his
lips, which felt dry as his tongue in his momentary nervousness,
then he stepped closer to the counter.</p>
<p>"Good-day, monsieur! I require a bedroom."</p>
<p>"A bedroom? But certainly, monsieur!" The shrewd though tired
eyes of the man passed over his visitor's clothes and the valise in
his hand. "We can give you a most excellent room at"&mdash;he
raised his eyebrows in tactful hesitation&mdash;"at five
francs?"</p>
<p>The boy's eyes opened in genuine, instant surprise. "For so
little?" he exclaimed. Then, covered with confusion, he reddened
furiously and stammered, "For&mdash;for so much, I mean?"</p>
<p>The man in the office was all smooth, politeness, anxious to
cover a foreigner's slip of speech. 'But certainly, no! If five
francs was more than monsieur cared to pay, then for three francs
there was a most charming, a most agreeable room on the fifth
floor. True, it did not look upon the street, but then perhaps
monsieur preferred quiet. If monsieur would give himself the
trouble of mounting&mdash;'</p>
<p>Monsieur, still confused by his own mistake, and nervously
anxious to insist upon his position, repeated again that five
francs was out of the question, and that, without giving himself
the trouble of mounting, he would then and there decide upon the
agreeable and quiet room at three francs.</p>
<p>'But certainly! It was understood!' The guardian of the office,
now fully awake and aroused to interest in this princely
transaction, disappeared from behind the counter into the back
regions of the hotel, and could be heard calling "Jean! Jean!" in a
high, insistent tone.</p>
<p>After some moments of silence he returned, followed by a large
and amiable individual in a dirty blue blouse, who had apparently
but lately arisen from sleep.</p>
<p>'Now if monsieur would intrust his baggage to the
valet&mdash;'</p>
<p>The guardian of the office took a key from a nail in the wall.
Jean stepped forward, pleased and self-conscious, and took the
valise from the boy's hand. Then all three smiled and bowed.</p>
<p>It was one of those foolish little comedies&mdash;utterly
unnecessary, curiously pleasant&mdash;that occur twenty times a day
in Parisian life. Involuntarily the adventurer's heart warmed to
the pallid clerk and to the dirty hotel porter. He had arrived here
without luggage, shabby, unrecommended, yet no princely compatriot
of his own could have been made more sensible of welcome. He
stepped out of the office and followed his guide, conscious that,
if only for an instant, Paris had lifted her mask and
smiled&mdash;the radiant, anticipated smile.</p>
<p>There is no such unnecessary luxury as a lift in the H&ocirc;tel
Railleux. At the back of the hall the spiral staircase begins its
steep ascent, mounting to unimagined heights.</p>
<p>Jean, breathing audibly, led the way, pausing at every landing
to assure monsieur that the ascent was nothing&mdash;a mere
nothing, and that before another thought could pass through
monsieur's mind the fifth floor would be reached. The boy followed,
climbing and ever climbing, until the meagre hand-rail appeared to
lengthen into dream-like coils, and the threadbare, drab-hued
carpet, with its vivid red border, to assume the proportions of
some confusing scroll.</p>
<p>But at length the end was reached, and Jean, beaming and
triumphant, announced their goal.</p>
<p>'This way! If monsieur would have the goodness to take two steps
in this direction!' He dived into a long, dark corridor,
illuminated by a single flickering gas-jet, twin brother to that
which lighted the office below; and, still eager, still breathing
loudly, he ushered the guest toward what in his humble soul he
believed to be the luxurious, the impressive bedroom supplied by
the H&ocirc;tel Railleux at three francs a night.</p>
<p>The boy looked about him as he passed down the dim corridor.
Apparently he and Jean alone were awake in this gloomy maze of
closed doors and sleeping passages. One sign of humanity&mdash;and
one alone&mdash;came to his senses with a suggestion of sordid
drama. On the floor, at the closed door of one of the rooms, stood
a battered black tray on which reposed an empty champagne bottle
and two soiled glasses.</p>
<p>Life! His quick imagination conjured a picture&mdash;conjured
and shrank from it. He turned away with a sense of sharp disgust
and almost ran down the corridor to where Jean was fitting a key
into the door of his prospective bedroom.</p>
<p>"The room, monsieur!" Jean's voice was full of pride. He had
lived for ten years in the H&ocirc;tel Railleux, working as six men
and six women together would not have worked in the fashionable
quarter, and he had never been shaken in his belief that Paris held
no more inviting hostelry.</p>
<p>The boy obediently stepped forward into the tiny apartment, in
which a big wooden bedstead loomed out of all proportion. His
movements were hasty, as though he desired to escape from some
impression; his voice, when he spoke, was vague.</p>
<p>"Very nice! Very nice!" he said. "And&mdash;and what is the
view?"</p>
<p>"The view? Oh, but monsieur will like the view!" Jean stepped to
the window, drew back the heavy cretonne curtains, and threw open
the long window, admitting a breath of chilling cold. "The
court-yard! See, monsieur! The court-yard!"</p>
<p>The boy came forward into the biting air and gazed down into the
well-like depths of gloom, at the bottom of which could be
discerned a small flagged court, ornamented by a couple of dwarfed
and frost-bitten trees in painted tubs.</p>
<p>Jean, watchful of the visitor's face, broke forth anew with
inexhaustible tact.</p>
<p>'It was a fine view&mdash;monsieur would admit that! But,
naturally, it was not the street! Now No. 107, across the
corridor&mdash;at five francs&mdash;?'</p>
<p>Monsieur was aroused. "No! No! certainly not. The view was of no
consequence. The bed looked all right."</p>
<p>'The bed!' Here Jean spoke with deep feeling. 'There was no
better bed in Paris. Had he not himself put clean sheets on it that
day?' He turned from the window, and with the hand of an expert
displayed the beauties of the sparse blankets, the cotton sheets,
and the mountainous double mattress.</p>
<p>'But monsieur was anxious to retire? Doubtless monsieur would
sleep until <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>? A most excellent
<i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> was served in the
<i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i> on the second floor.'</p>
<p>The words flowed forth in a stream&mdash;agreeable, monotonous,
reminiscent of the far-away province that had long ago bred this
good creature. Suddenly the exhaustion of the long journey, the
sleep so long denied rose about the traveller like a misty vapor.
He longed for solitude; he pined for rest.</p>
<p>"I am satisfied with everything," he said, abruptly. "Leave me.
I have not been in bed for two nights."</p>
<p>A flood of sympathy overspread Jean's face: he threw up his
hands. "Poor boy! Poor boy! What a terrible thing!" With a touch as
light as a woman's his work-worn fingers smoothed the pillow
invitingly, and, tiptoeing to the door, he disappeared in tactful
and silent comprehension of the situation.</p>
<p>Vaguely the boy was conscious of his departure. A great
lassitude was falling upon him, making him value the isolation of
his three-franc room with a deep gratitude, turning his gaze toward
the unpromising bed with an indescribable longing. Mechanically, as
the door closed, he threw off his heavy overcoat, kicked off his
high boots, discarded his coat and trousers, and, without waiting
to search in his bag for another garment, stepped into bed and
curled himself up in the flannel shirt he had worn all day.</p>
<p>The bed was uncomfortable with that extraordinary discomfort of
the old-fashioned French bed, that feels as though it were padded
with cotton wool of indescribable heaviness. The sheets were
coarse, the multitudinous clothes were weighty without being warm,
but no prince on his bed of roses ever rested with more luxury of
repose than did this young adventurer as, drawing the blankets to
his chin, he stretched his limbs with the slow, delicious enjoyment
born of long travel.</p>
<p>Jean had drawn the cretonne curtains, but through their chinks
streaks of bluish, shadowy light presaged the coming day. From his
lair the boy looked out at these ghostly fingers of the morning,
then his eyes travelled round the dark room until at last they
rested upon his clothes lying, as he had thrown them, on the floor.
He looked at them&mdash;the boots, the coat and trousers, the heavy
overcoat&mdash;and suddenly some imperative thought banished sleep
from his eyes. He sat up in bed; he shivered as the cold air nipped
his shoulder; then, unhesitatingly, he slipped from between the
sheets and slid out upon the floor.</p>
<p>The room was small; the clothes lay within an arm's length. He
shivered again, stooped, and, picking up the overcoat, dived his
hand into the deep pocket, and drew forth the packet that he had
guarded so tenaciously in the train.</p>
<p>For a moment he stood looking at it in the blue light of the
dawn&mdash;a thick brown packet, seven or eight inches long, tied
with string and sealed. Once or twice he looked at it, seemingly
lost in reflection; once or twice he turned it about in his hand as
if to make certain it was intact; then, with a deep sigh indicative
of satisfaction, he stepped back into bed, slipped the packet under
his pillow and, with his fingers faithfully enlaced in the string,
fell asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">IT was eleven o'clock when the boy woke. All the
excitement of the past days had culminated in the great exhaustion
of the night before.</div>
<p>He had slept as a child might sleep&mdash;dreamlessly, happily,
unthinkingly. In that silent hour Nature had drawn him into her
wide embrace, lulling him with a mother's gentleness; and now, in
the moment of waking, it seemed that again the same beneficent
agency was dispensing love and favor, for he opened his eyes upon a
changed world. A magician's wand had been waved over the city
during his hours of sleep; the mist and oppression of the night had
disappeared with the darkness. Paris was under the dominion of the
frost.</p>
<p>Instinctively, even before his eyelids lifted, the northern soul
within him apprised him of this change. He inhaled the crisp
coldness of the air with a vague familiarity; he opened his eyes
slowly and stared about the unknown room in an instant of
hesitating doubt; then, with a great leap of the spirit, he
recognized his position. Last night&mdash;the days and nights that
had preceded it&mdash;flooded his consciousness, and in a moment he
was out of bed and pulling back the drab-hued curtains that hid the
window.</p>
<p>Having freed the daylight, he leaned out, peering greedily down
into the well-like court, where even the stunted trees in their
painted tubs were coated white with rime; then, with another
impulse, as quickly conceived, as quickly executed, he drew back
into the room, fired with the desire to be out and about in this
newly created world.</p>
<p>By day, the details of the room stood out with a prominence that
had been denied them in the dim candle-light of the night before,
and he realized now, what had escaped him then, that there was
neither dressing-table, wardrobe, nor chest of drawers, that the
entire space of the small apartment was filled by the clumsy bed, a
folding wash-stand, and two ponderous arm-chairs covered in shabby
red velvet. These, with a dingy gold-framed mirror hanging above
the tiny corner fireplace, and a gilt clock under a glass shade,
formed the comforts purchasable for three francs.</p>
<p>He studied it all solemnly and attentively, not omitting the
gray wall-paper of melancholy design, and content that he had
acquitted himself dutifully toward his surroundings, he unpacked
his valise, and proceeded to dress for the day's happenings.</p>
<p>The contents of the valise were not imposing&mdash;a change of
linen, a soft felt hat, a pair of shoes, and a well-worn blue serge
suit. The boy looked at each article as he drew it forth with a
quaint attentiveness quite disproportionate to either its
appearance or its value. But the process seemed to please him, and
he lingered over it, ceasing almost reluctantly to appraise his
belongings, and beginning to dress.</p>
<p>This morning he discarded the high Russian boots and the fur cap
of yesterday, and arrayed himself instead, and with much precision,
in the serge suit. Worn as this suit was, it evidently retained a
pristine value in its owner's eyes, for no sooner had he fastened
the last button of the coat than he looked instinctively for the
mirror in which to study the effect.</p>
<p>The mirror unfortunately was high and, crane his neck as he
might, he could see nothing beyond the waves of his short, dark
hair and his eager, questioning eyes. But the effect must be
observed, and, with an anxiety in seeming contrast to his nature,
he pulled one of the massive velvet chairs to the fireplace and,
mounting upon it, surveyed himself at every angle with deep
intentness. At last, satisfied, he jumped to the ground, and taking
the brown-paper packet from the hiding-place where it had reposed
all night, bestowed it again in the pocket of his overcoat and,
picking up the felt hat, left the room.</p>
<p>The corridor, despite the advent of the day, was still dark,
save where an occasional door stood ajar and a shaft of sun from
the outer world shot across the drab carpet; but Jean had been over
the floor with his broom while the hotel slept, and the battered
tray with its suggestion of sordid festivity had been removed. Even
here the electric air of the morning had made entry, and, yielding
to its seduction, the boy gave rein to his eagerness as he hurried
forward to the head of the stairs and laid his hand upon the meagre
banister.</p>
<p>From the hall below the white light of the day ascended with
subtle invitation, while outside the world hummed with
possibilities. He began the descent, light as a Mercury, his feet
scarcely touching the steps that last night had offered so toilsome
a progress, and on the third floor he encountered Jean, bearing
another tray laden with plates and covered dishes.</p>
<p>At sight of the young face, the good creature's smile broke
forth irresistibly.</p>
<p>'Ah, but monsieur had slept!' The little eyes ran over the face
and figure of the guest with visible pleasure.</p>
<p>The boy laughed&mdash;the full, light-hearted laugh that belongs
to the beginning of things.</p>
<p>"Yes, I have slept; and now, you may believe, I have an
appetite!"</p>
<p>Jean echoed the laugh with a spontaneity that held no
disrespect. He lingered, drawn, as the Irishman in the train had
been drawn, by something original, something vital, in the youthful
personality.</p>
<p>'His faith! But monsieur had the spirit as well as the
appetite!'</p>
<p>"Ah, the spirit!" For a fleeting second the boy's eyes looked
away beyond Jean&mdash;untidy, attentive,
comprehending&mdash;beyond the neutral-tinted walls and the shabby
carpet of the H&ocirc;tel Railleux, seeing in vision the things
that were to come. Then, with his swift impulsiveness, he flung his
dream from him. What mattered the future? What mattered the past?
He was here in the present&mdash;in the moment; and the moment,
great or small, demanded living.</p>
<p>"Never mind the spirit, Jean! Let us consider the flesh! Where
is the <i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i>?"</p>
<p>'The <i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i> was on the second floor.'</p>
<p>'The second floor? But of course! Had not Jean mentioned that
fact last night?' With a nod and a smile, he was away down the
intervening steps and at the door of the eating-room before Jean
could balance his tray for his renewed ascent.</p>
<p>The room that the boy entered was in keeping with the rest of
the house&mdash;old-fashioned and in ill-repair. The floor was
devoid of covering, the ceiling low, the only furniture a dozen
small tables meagrely set out for <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>. On the
moment of his entry eleven of these tables were unoccupied, but at
the twelfth an eager young waiter attended upon a stout provincial
Frenchwoman who was partaking heartily of a pungently smelling
stew.</p>
<p>On the opening of the door the waiter glanced round in strained
anticipation, and the lady of the stew looked up and bowed a
greeting to the new-comer.</p>
<p>It struck the boy as curious&mdash;this welcome from a total
stranger, but it woke anew the pleasant warmth, the agreeable sense
of friendliness. With the tingling sensation of doing a daring
deed, he glanced round the empty room, scanned the two long windows
on which the cold, bright sun played laughingly, and through which
the rattle and hum of the rue de Dunkerque penetrated like an
exhilarating accompaniment, then, he walked straight to the table
of the lady, smiled and, in his own turn, bowed.</p>
<p>'Would madame permit him to sit at her table? It was sad to be
alone upon so fine a morning.'</p>
<p>A woman of any other nationality might have looked at him
askance; but madame was French. She was fifty years of age, she was
fat, she was ugly&mdash;but she was French. The sense of a pleasant
encounter&mdash;the appreciation of romance was in her blood. She
smiled at the debonair boy with as agreeable a self-consciousness
as though she had been a young girl.</p>
<p>'But certainly, if monsieur desired. The pleasure was for
her.'</p>
<p>Again an interchange of bows and smiles, sympathetically
repeated by the interested young waiter. Then the boy, laying his
hat and coat aside, seated himself at the table and entered upon
the business of the hour, while madame became tactfully absorbed in
her odoriferous stew.</p>
<p>'What did monsieur desire?' The waiter stood anxiously
attentive, his head inclining gravely to one side, his dirty napkin
swinging from his left hand.</p>
<p>The boy glanced up.</p>
<p>'What could the H&ocirc;tel Railleux offer?'</p>
<p>The waiter met his eye steadfastly. 'Anything that monsieur
cared to order.'</p>
<p>The boy encountered the steadfast look, and a little gleam of
humor shot into his eyes.</p>
<p>'Well, then, to begin with, should they say <i>Sole
Waleska</i>?'</p>
<p>The waiter's glance wavered, he threw the weight of his body
from one foot to the other. Involuntarily madame looked up.</p>
<p>The boy buried himself behind an expression of profound
seriousness.</p>
<p>"Yes! <i>Sole Waleska</i>! Or, perhaps, <i>Coulibiac &agrave; la
Russe!"</i></p>
<p>The waiter's mouth opened in a desperate resolve to meet the
worst. Madame's eyes discreetly sought her plate.</p>
<p>The boy threw back his head and laughed aloud at his own small
jest. "Bring me two eggs <i>en cocotte</i>," he substituted, and
laughed again in sheer pleasure at the waiter's sudden smile, his
sudden restoration to dignity, as he hurried away to put a seal
upon an order that permitted the hotel to retain its
self-respect.</p>
<p>Again madame looked up. 'Monsieur was fond of his little
pleasantry! This waiter was a good boy, but slow. They did not keep
a sufficiency of servants at the H&ocirc;tel Railleux. But
doubtless monsieur had noticed that?'</p>
<p>The boy met her inquisitive glance with disarming frankness, but
his words when he answered gave little information.</p>
<p>'No. He had not as yet had time to notice anything.'</p>
<p>'But of course! Monsieur was a new arrival? He had
come&mdash;when was it&mdash;?' Madame appeared to search her
memory.</p>
<p>'Yesterday.'</p>
<p>'But of course. Yesterday! And what a day it had been! What
weather for a long journey! It had been a long journey, had it
not?'</p>
<p>The boy looked vague. 'Oh, it had been of a sufficient
length!'</p>
<p>Madame toyed with the remnants of her stew. 'It had, perhaps,
been a journey from England? Monsieur was not French, although he
had so charming a fluency in the language?' Her eyes, her whole
provincial, inquisitive face begged for information, but the boy
was firm.</p>
<p>'We are each of the country God has given us!' he informed her.
Then he added with convincing certainty that madame was without
doubt <i>Parisienne</i>.</p>
<p>Madame bridled at the soothing little falsehood.</p>
<p>'Alas! nothing so interesting. She was of the provinces.'</p>
<p>'Provincial! Impossible!'</p>
<p>At once the ice was broken; at once they were on the footing of
friends, and madame's soul poured forth its secret vanities.</p>
<p>'Monsieur was too kind. No, she was provincial&mdash;though, of
a truth, Paris was so well known to her that she might almost claim
to be <i>Parisienne</i>.'</p>
<p>The boy's interest was undiminished. 'Might he venture to ask if
it was pleasure alone that had brought madame to the
capital&mdash;or had business&mdash;?' He left the sentence
discreetly unfinished.</p>
<p>Madame pushed her empty plate away and took a toothpick from the
table.</p>
<p>'How observant was monsieur!' She eyed the bright young face
with growing approval. 'Yes, business, alas, was the pivot of her
visit! This terrible business&mdash;exacting so much, giving so
little in return!' She heaved a weighty sigh, then her fat face
melted into smiles. 'But after all, what would you?' She shrugged
her ample shoulders, and the toothpick came into full play.</p>
<p>'What would you, indeed?' The boy began to feel a little
disconcerted under her glance of slow approval, and a swift sense
of relief passed through him as the door opened and the waiter
reappeared, carrying the two eggs.</p>
<p>'What would you, indeed? One must live!' Madame, disregarding
the waiter, continued to study the boyish face&mdash;the curious
dark-gray eyes, in which the morning sun was discovering little
flecks of gold. 'And every year conditions were becoming harder, as
monsieur doubtless knew.'</p>
<p>Monsieur nodded his head sagely, and began to eat his eggs with
keen zest.</p>
<p>Madame looked slowly round at the waiter and ordered coffee,
then her glance returned to the boy.</p>
<p>'How good, how refreshing it was to see him eat! How easy to
comprehend that he was young!' She sighed again, this time more
softly. 'Youth was a marvellous thing&mdash;and Paris was the city
of the young! Was monsieur making a long stay at the H&ocirc;tel
Railleux?'</p>
<p>The waiter again appeared and placed the coffee upon the table.
Monsieur, suddenly and unaccountably uneasy, finished his eggs
hastily and pushed his plate aside.</p>
<p>'Did monsieur desire coffee?' Madame leaned forward. 'If so, it
would be but the matter of a moment to procure a second cup; and,
as her coffee-pot was quite full&mdash;' She raised the lid
coquettishly, and again her eyes lingered upon the short dark hair
and the straight brows above the gray eyes.</p>
<p>The waiter with ready tact departed in search of the second cup;
madame replaced the lid of the coffee-pot.</p>
<p>'Now that they were alone, would it be an unpardonable liberty
to ask how old monsieur really was?'</p>
<p>Monsieur blushed.</p>
<p>'How old would madame suppose?'</p>
<p>Madame laughed. 'Oh, it was difficult to say! One might imagine
from those bright eyes that monsieur had nineteen years; but,
again, it was impossible to suppose that a razor had ever touched
that soft cheek.' There was another little laugh, lower this time
and more subtle in tone; and madame, with a movement wonderfully
swift considering her years and her proportions, leaned across the
table and touched the boy's face.</p>
<p>The effect was instant. A tide of color rushed into his cheeks,
he rose with an alacrity that was comic.</p>
<p>'He&mdash;he was much older than madame supposed!'</p>
<p>Madame laughed delightedly. 'How charming! How ingenuous! He
positively must sit down again. It was assured that they would
become friends! Where was that waiter? Where was that second
coffee-cup?'</p>
<p>But monsieur remained standing.</p>
<p>Madame's eyes, now alive with interest, literally danced to her
thoughts.</p>
<p>'Come! Come! They must not allow the coffee to become cold!'</p>
<p>But monsieur picked up his hat and coat.</p>
<p>'What! He was not going? Oh, it was impossible! He could not be
so unkind!' Her face expressed dismay.</p>
<p>But her only answer was a stiff little bow, and a second later
the door had closed and the boy was running down the stairs of the
hotel as though some enemy were in hot pursuit.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_IV'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">THE mind of the boy was very full as he passed
out of the hotel, so full that he scarcely noticed the whip of cold
air that stung his face or the white mantle that lay upon the
streets, wrapping in a silver sheath all that was sordid, all that
was dirty and unpicturesque in that corner of Paris. The human note
had been touched in that moment in the
<i>salle-&agrave;-manger,</i> and his ears still tingled to its
sound. Alarm, disgust, and a strange exultant satisfaction warred
within him in a manner to be comprehended by his own soul
alone.</div>
<p>As he stepped out into the rue de Dunkerque he scarcely
questioned in what direction his feet should carry him. North,
south, east, or west were equal on that first day. Everywhere was
promise&mdash;everywhere a call. Nonchalantly and without intention
he turned to the left and found himself once more in face of the
Gare du Nord.</p>
<p>It is a good thing to rejoice in spite of the world; it is an
infinitely better thing to rejoice in company with it. With
solitude and freedom, the alarm, the disgust receded, and as he
went forward the exultation grew, until once again his mercurial
spirits lifted him as upon wings.</p>
<p>The majority of passers-by at this morning hour were
workers&mdash;work-girls out upon their errands, business men going
to or from the <i>caf&eacute;s</i>; but here and there was to be
seen an artist, consciously indifferent to appearances; here and
there an artisan, unconsciously picturesque in his coarse
working-clothes; here and there a well-dressed woman, sunning
herself in the cold, bright air like a bird of gay plumage. It was
the world in miniature, and it stirred and piqued his interest. A
wish to stop one of these people, and to pour forth his longings,
his hopes, his dreams, surged within him in a glow of fellowship
and, smiling to himself at the pleasant wildness of the thought, he
made his way through the wider spaces of the Place Lafayette and
the Square Montholon into the long, busy rue Lafayette.</p>
<p>Here, in the rue Lafayette, the gloomy aspects of the district
he had made his own dropped behind him, and a wealth of bustle and
gayety greeted and fascinated him. Here the sun seemed fuller, the
traffic was more dense, and the shops offered visions to please
every sense. Wine shops were here, curio shops, shops all golden
and tempting with cheeses and butter, and hat shops that foretold
the spring in a glitter of blues and greens. He passed on, jostling
the crowd good-humoredly, being jostled in the same spirit, hugging
his freedom with a silent joy.</p>
<p>Down the rue Hal&eacute;vy he went and on into the Place de
l'Op&eacute;ra; but here he slackened his pace, and something of
his <i>insouciance</i> dropped from him. The wide space filled with
its cosmopolitan crowd, the opera-house itself, so aloof in its
dark splendor, spoke to him of another Paris&mdash;the Paris that
might be Vienna, Petersburg, London, for all it has to say of
individual life. His mood changed; he paused and looked back over
his shoulder in the direction from whence he had come. But the
hesitation was fleeting; a quick courage followed on the doubt. The
adventurer must take life in every aspect&mdash;must face all
questions, all moments! He turned up the collar of his coat, as
though preparing to face a chillier region, and went forward boldly
as before.</p>
<p>One or two narrow streets brought him out upon the Place de
Rivoli, where Joan of Arc sat astride her golden horse, and where
great heaps of flowers were stacked at the street
corners&mdash;mimosa, lilac, violets. He halted irresistibly to
glance at these flowers breathing of the south, and to glance at
the shining statue. Then he crossed the rue de Rivoli and, passing
through the garden of the Tuileries, emerged upon the Place de la
Concorde.</p>
<p>On the Place de la Concorde the cool, clean hand of the morning
had drawn its most striking picture; here, in the great,
unsheltered spaces, the frost had fallen heavily, softening and
beautifying to an inconceivable degree. The suggestion of modernity
that ordinarily hangs over the place was veiled, and the subtle
hints of history stole forth, binding the imagination. It needed
but a touch to materialize the dream as the boy crossed the white
roadway, shadowed by the white statuary, and with an odd
appropriateness the touch was given.</p>
<p>One moment his mind was a sea of shifting visions, the next it
was caught and held by an inevitably thrilling sound&mdash;the
sound of feet tramping to a martial tune. The touch had been given:
the vague visions of tradition and history crystallized into a
picture, and his heart leaped to the pulsing, steady tramp, to the
clash of fife and drum ringing out upon the fine cold air.</p>
<p>All humanity is drawn by the sight of soldiers. There is a
primitive exhilaration in the idea of marching men that will last
while the nations live. Stung by the same impulse that affected
every man and woman in the Place de la Concorde, the boy
paused&mdash;his head up, his pulses quickened, his eyes and ears
strained toward the sound.</p>
<p>It was a regiment of infantry marching down the Cours la Reine
and defiling out upon the Place de la Concorde toward the rue de
Rivoli. By a common impulse he paused, and by an equally common
desire to be close to the object of interest, he ran forward to
where a little crowd had gathered in the soldiers' route.</p>
<p>The French soldier is not individually interesting, and this
body of men looked insignificant enough upon close inspection. Yet
it was a regiment; it stirred the fancy; and the boy gazed with
keen interest at the small figures in the ill-fitting uniforms and
at the faces, many as young as his own, that denied past him in
confusing numbers. On and on the regiment wound, a coiling line of
dull red and bluish-gray against the frosty background, the feet
tramping steadily, the fifes and drums beating out with an
incessant clamor.</p>
<p>Then, without warning, a new interest touched the knot of
watchers, a thrill passed from one member of the crowd to another,
and hats were raised. The colors were being borne by: Frenchmen
were saluting their flag.</p>
<p>The knowledge sprang to the boy's mind with the swiftness and
poignancy of an inspiration. This body of men might be
insignificant, but it represented the army of France&mdash;a thing
of infinite tradition, of infinite romance. The blood mounted to
his face, his heart beat faster, and with a strange, half-shy sense
of participating in some fine moment, his hand went up to his
hat.</p>
<p>Unconsciously he made a picture as he stood there, his dark hair
stirred by the light, early air, his young face beautiful in its
sudden enthusiasm; and to one pair of eyes in the little crowd it
seemed better worth watching than the passing soldiers.</p>
<p>The owner of these eyes had been observant of him from the
moment that he had run forward, drawn by the rattle of the drums;
and now, as if in acceptance of an anticipated opportunity, he
forced a way through the knot of people and, pausing behind the
boy, addressed him in an easy, familiar voice, as one friend might
address another.</p>
<p>"Isn't it odd," he said, "to look at those insignificant
creatures, and to think that the soldiers of France have kissed the
women and thrashed the men the world over?"</p>
<p>Had a gun been discharged close to his car the boy could not
have started more violently. Fear leaped into his eyes, he wheeled
round; then a sharp, nervous laugh of relief escaped him.</p>
<p>"How you frightened me!" he exclaimed. "Oh, how you frightened
me!" Then he laughed again.</p>
<p>His travelling companion of the night before smiled down on him
from his superior height, and the boy noted for the first time that
this smile had a peculiarly attractive way of communicating itself
from the clean-shaven lips to the grayish-green eyes of the
stranger, banishing the slightly satirical look that marked his
face in repose.</p>
<p>"Well?" The Irishman was still studying him.</p>
<p>"Well? We're all on the knees of the gods, you see! 'Twas
written that we were to meet; you can't avoid me."</p>
<p>The flag had been carried past; the boy replaced his hat, glad
of a moment in which to collect his thoughts. What must he do? The
question beat in his brain. Wisdom whispered avoidance of this
stranger. To-day was the first day; was it wise to bring into it
anything from yesterday? No, it was not wise&mdash;reason upheld
wisdom. He pulled his hat into place, his lips came together in an
obstinate line, and he raised his eyes.</p>
<p>The sun was dancing on a silvery world, from the rue de Rivoli
the fifes and drums still rattled out their march, close beside him
the Irishman was looking at him with his pleasant smile.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as a daring horseman might give rein to a young horse,
rejoicing in the risk, the boy discarded wisdom and its whispering
curb; his nature leaped forth in sudden comradeship, and
impulsively he held out his hand.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, forgive me!" he said. "The gods know best!"</p>
<p>He said the words in English, perfectly, easily, with that
faintest of all foreign intonations&mdash;the intonation that
clings to the Russian voice.</p>
<hr style='width: 65%;'>

<a name='CHAPTER_V'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">SO the step was taken, and two souls, drawn
together from different countries, different races, touched in a
first subtle fusion. With an ease kindled by the fine and stinging
air, stimulated by the crisp summons of the flutes and the martial
rattle of the drums, they bridged the thousand preliminaries that
usually hedge a friendship, and arrived in a moment of intuition at
that consciousness of fellowship that is the most divine of human
gifts.</div>
<p>As though the affair had been prearranged through countless
ages, they turned by one accord and forced a way through the crowd
that still encompassed them. Across the Place de la Concorde they
went, past the white statues, past the open space through which the
soldiers were still defiling like a dark stream in a snowbound
country. Each was drawn instinctively toward the Cours la
Reine&mdash;the point from whence the stream was pouring, the point
where the crowd of loiterers was sparsest, where the bare and
frosted trees caught the sun in a million dancing facets. Reaching
it, the boy looked up into the stranger's face with his fascinating
look of question and interest.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, tell me something! How did you know me again? And why
did you speak to me?"</p>
<p>The question was grave, with the charming gravity that was wont
to cross his gayety as shadows chase each other across a sunlit
pool. His lips were parted na&iuml;vely, his curious slate-gray
eyes demanded the truth.</p>
<a name="souls"></a>
<center><img src="images/ill044.jpg" width="400" height="613" alt=
"TWO SOULS, DRAWN TOGETHER, TOUCHED IN A FIRST SUBTLE FUSION"></center>
<h5>TWO SOULS, DRAWN TOGETHER, TOUCHED IN A FIRST SUBTLE
FUSION</h5>
<p>The Irishman recognized the demand, and answered it.</p>
<p>"Now that you put it to me," he said, thoughtfully, "I'm not
sure that I can tell you. There's something about you&mdash;" His
thoughtfulness deepened, and he studied the boy through narrowed
eyes. "It isn't that you're odd in any way."</p>
<p>The boy reddened.</p>
<p>"It isn't that you're odd," he insisted, "but somehow you're
such a slip of a boy&mdash;" His voice grew meditative and he
recurred to his native trick of phrasing, as he always did when
interested or moved.</p>
<p>"But why did you speak to me? I'm not interesting."</p>
<p>"Oh yes, you are!"</p>
<p>"How am I interesting?" There was a flash in the gray eyes that
revealed new flecks of gold.</p>
<p>The Irishman hesitated.</p>
<p>"Well, I can't explain it," he said, slowly, "unless I tell you
that you throw a sort of spell&mdash;and that sounds absurd. You
see, I've knocked about the world a bit, east and west, but at the
back of everything I'm an Irishman; I have a fondness for the
curious and the poetical and the mysterious, and somehow you seemed
to me last night to be mystery itself, with your silence and your
intentness." He dropped his voice to the meditative key,
unconsciously enjoying its soft, half-melancholy cadences, and as
he spoke the boy felt some chord in his own personality vibrate to
the mind that had asked for no introduction, demanded no
credentials, that had decreed their friendship and materialized
it.</p>
<p>"No," the Irishman mused on, "there's no explaining it. You were
mystery itself, and you fired my imagination, because I happen to
come from a country of dreams. We Irish are born dreamers;
sometimes we never wake up at all, and then we're counted failures.
But, I tell you what, when all's said and done, we see what other
men don't see. For instance, what do you think my two friends saw
in you last night?"</p>
<p>The boy shook his head, and there was a tremor of nervousness
about his mouth.</p>
<p>"They saw something dangerous&mdash;something to be avoided. Yet
Mac is a millionaire several times over, and Billy is distinctly a
diplomatist with a future."</p>
<p>The boy forced a smile; he was beginning to shrink from the
pleasant scrutiny, to wish that the vaporous fog of last night
might dim the searching light of the morning.</p>
<p>"What did they see?" he asked.</p>
<p>The Irishman looked at him humorously. "I hardly like to tell it
to you," he said, "but they marked you for an anarchist. An
anarchist, for all the world! As if any anarchist alive would
travel first-class in third-class clothes! You see, I'm blunt."</p>
<p>The boy, studying him, half in fear, half in doubt, laughed
suddenly in quick relief and amusement.</p>
<p>"An anarchist! How droll!"</p>
<p>"Wasn't it? I told them so. I also told them&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"My own beliefs."</p>
<p>"And your beliefs?"</p>
<p>"No! No! You won't draw me! But I'll tell you this much, for
I've told it before. I knew you were no common creature of
intrigue; I accepted you as mystery personified."</p>
<p>"And now you would solve me?" In his returning confidence the
boy's eyes danced.</p>
<p>"God forbid!" The vehemence of the reply was comic, and the
Irishman himself laughed as the words escaped him. "Oh no!" he
added, soberly. "Keep your mask! I don't want to tear it from you.
Later on, perhaps, I'll take a peep behind; but I can accept
mysteries and miracles&mdash;I was born into the Roman Catholic
Church."</p>
<p>"And I into the Greek."</p>
<p>"Ah! My first peep!"</p>
<p>"And what do you see?"</p>
<p>"Do you know, I see a queer thing. I see a boy who has thought.
You have thought. Don't deny it!"</p>
<p>"On religion?"</p>
<p>"On religion&mdash;and other things; you acknowledge it in one
look."</p>
<p>The boy laughed, like a child who has been caught at some
forbidden game.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it was your imagination."</p>
<p>"Perhaps! But, look here, we can't stand all day discoursing in
the Cours la Reine! Where shall we wander&mdash;left or right?" He
nodded first in the direction of the river, then toward the large
building that faced them on the right, from the roof of which an
array of small flags fluttered an invitation.</p>
<p>The boy's eyes followed his movement. "Pictures!" he exclaimed.
"I didn't know there was an exhibition open."</p>
<p>"Live and learn! Come along!"</p>
<p>Together they stepped into the roadway, where the frosty surface
was scarred by the soldiers' feet, and together they reached the
doorway of the large building and read the legend,
"<i>Socti&eacute;t&eacute; Peintres et Sculpteurs
Fran&ccedil;ais</i>."</p>
<p>The Irishman read the words with the faintly humorous, faintly
sceptical glance that he seemed to bestow upon the world at
large.</p>
<p>"Remember I'm throwing out no bait, but I expect 'twill be value
for a couple of francs."</p>
<p>They entered the bare hall and, mounting a cold and rigid
staircase, found themselves confronted by a turnstile.</p>
<p>The Irishman was in the act of laying a two-franc piece in the
hand of the custodian when the boy plucked him by the sleeve and,
turning, he saw the curious eyes full of a sudden anxiety.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, pardon me! You know Paris well?"</p>
<p>"I live here for five months out of the twelve."</p>
<p>"Then you can tell me if&mdash;if this exhibition will be well
attended. I want with all my heart to see the pictures, but
I&mdash;I dislike crowds&mdash;fashionable crowds." His voice was
agitated; it was as if he had suddenly awakened from his pleasant
dream of Bohemian comradeship to a remembrance of the Paris that
lay about him.</p>
<p>The Irishman expressed no surprise: his only reply was to move
nearer to the guardian of the turnstile.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," he said in French, "have the goodness to inform me
how many persons have passed through the turnstile this
morning?"</p>
<p>The man looked at him without interest, though with some
surprise. 'Not many of the world were to be seen at such an hour,'
he informed him. 'So far, he had admitted two
gentlemen&mdash;artists, and three ladies&mdash;American.'</p>
<p>The Irishman waved his hand toward the turnstile.</p>
<p>"In with you! The world forgetting, by the world forgot!"</p>
<p>His ease of manner was contagious. Whatever misgivings had
assailed the boy were banished with this reassurance, and his
confidence flowed back as the custodian took the two-franc piece
and the turnstile clicked twice, making them free of the long, bare
galleries that opened in front of them.</p>
<p>Inured as he was to cold, he shivered as they passed into the
first of these long rooms, and involuntarily buried his chin in the
collar of his coat. The chill of the place was vaultlike; the cold,
gray light that penetrated it held nothing of the sun's comfort,
while the small, black stove set in the middle of the room was a
mere travesty of warmth.</p>
<p>"God bless my soul!" began the Irishman, "this is art for art's
sake&mdash;"</p>
<p>But there he stopped, for his companion, with the impetuosity of
his temperament, had suddenly caught sight of a picture that
interested him, and had darted across the room, leaving him to his
own reflections.</p>
<p>The boy was standing perfectly still, entirely engrossed, when
he came silently up behind him, and paused to look over his
shoulder. They were alone in the vast and chilly room save for one
attendant who dozed over some knitting in a corner near the door.
Away into the distance stretched the other rooms, bound one to the
other like links in a chain. From the third of these came the
penetrating voices of the American ladies, descanting
unhesitatingly upon the pictures; while in the second the two
artists could be seen flitting from one canvas to another with a
restless, nervous activity.</p>
<p>These facts came subconsciously to the Irishman, for his eyes
and his thoughts were for the boy and the subject of the boy's
interest&mdash;a picture curiously repulsive, yet curiously binding
in its realism of conception. It was a large canvas that formed one
of a group of five or six studies by a particular artist. The
details of the picture scarcely held the mind, for the imagination
of the beholder was instantly caught and enchained by the central
figure&mdash;the figure of a great ape, painted with cruel and
extraordinary truth. The animal was squatting upon the ground,
devouring a luscious fruit; its small and greedy eyes were alight
with gluttony; in its unbridled appetite, its hairy fingers crushed
the fruit against its sharp teeth, while the juice dripped from its
mouth.</p>
<p>The intimate, undisguised portrayal of greed shocked the
susceptibilities, but it was the hideous human attributes patent in
the brute that disgusted the imagination. With a terrible cunning
of mind and brush the artist had laid bare a vice that civilization
cloaks.</p>
<p>For two or three minutes the boy stood immovable, then he looked
back over his shoulder, and the man behind him was surprised at the
expression that had overspread his face, the sombre light that
glowed in his eyes. In a moment the adventurer was lost, another
being had come uppermost&mdash;a strange, unexpected being.</p>
<p>"What do you think of this picture?"</p>
<p>The Irishman did not answer for a moment, then his eyes returned
to the canvas and his tongue was loosed.</p>
<p>"If you want to know," he said, "I think it's the most damnable
thing I've ever seen. When the Gallic mind runs to morbidity
there's nothing to touch it for filth."</p>
<p>"Why filth?"</p>
<p>"Why filth? My dear boy, look at this&mdash;and this!" He
pointed to the other pictures, each a study of monkey life, each a
travesty of some human passion.</p>
<p>The boy obeyed, conscientiously and slowly, then once more his
eyes challenged his companion's.</p>
<p>"I say again, why filth?"</p>
<p>"Because there is enough of the beast in every man without
advertising it."</p>
<p>"You admit that there is something of the beast in every
man?"</p>
<p>"Naturally."</p>
<p>"Then why fear to see it?" The boy's face was pale, his eyes
still challenged.</p>
<p>The other made a gesture of impatience. "It isn't a question of
fear; it is a question of&mdash;well, of taste."</p>
<p>"Taste!" The boy tossed the word to scorn.</p>
<p>"What would you substitute?"</p>
<p>"Truth." There was a tremor in his voice, a veil seemed to fall
upon his youth, arresting its carelessness, sobering its
vitality.</p>
<p>The Irishman raised his brows. "Truth, eh?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It is only possible to live when we know life truly, see
it and value it truly."</p>
<p>"There may be perverted truth."</p>
<p>"You say that because this truth we speak of displeases you; yet
this is no more a perversion of the truth than"&mdash;he glanced
round the walls&mdash;"than that, for example; yet you would
approve of that."</p>
<p>He waved his hand toward another painting, a delicate and
charming conception of a half-clothed woman, a picture in which the
flesh-tints, the drapery, the lights all harmonized with exquisite
art.</p>
<p>"You would approve of that because it pleases your eye and
soothes your senses, yet you know that all womankind is not slim
and graciou&mdash;that all life is not lived in boudoirs."</p>
<p>"Neither is man all beast."</p>
<p>"Ah, that is it! If we are to be students of human nature we
must not be swayed in one direction or the other; and that is the
difficulty&mdash;to be dispassionate. Sometimes it is&mdash;very
difficult!"</p>
<p>It came with a charm indescribable, this sudden admission of
weakness, accompanied by a deprecating, pleading glance, and the
Irishman was filled with a sudden sense of having recovered
something personal and precious.</p>
<p>"What are you?" he cried. "It's my turn to seek the truth now.
What are you, you incomprehensible being?"</p>
<p>The boy laughed, the old careless, light-hearted laugh of the
creature infinitely free.</p>
<p>"Do not ask! Do not ask!" he said. "A riddle is only interesting
while it is unsolved."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">WITH the laugh the personal moment passed.
Henceforward it was the technique of the pictures, the
individualism of the artists that claimed the boy's attention, and
in this new field he proved himself yet another being&mdash;a
creature of quick perception and curiously mature judgment,
appreciative and observant, critical and generous.</div>
<p>In warm and interested discussion they made the tour of the
rooms, and when they emerged again into the frosty morning air and
were greeted by the dazzle of the sun, each was conscious of a
deeper understanding. A new expression of interest and something of
respect was visible in the Irishman's face as he looked down on the
puzzling, elusive being whom he had picked up from the skirts of
chance as he might have filched a jewel or a coin.</p>
<p>"Look here, boy!" he said, "we mustn't say good-bye just yet.
Come across the river, and let's find some little place where we
can get a seat and a cup of coffee."</p>
<p>The boy's only answer was to turn obediently, as the other
slipped his hand through his arm, and to allow himself to be guided
back across the Cours la Reine and over the Pont Alexandre III.</p>
<p>The bridge looked almost as impressive as the Place de la
Concorde under its white garment, and his glance ranged from the
high columns, topped by the winged horses, to the thronging bronze
lamps, while the sense of breath and freedom fitted with his secret
thoughts.</p>
<p>Leaving the river behind them, they made their way onward across
the Esplanade des Invalides, through the serried lines of trees,
stark and formal against the January sky, to the rue Fabert. Here,
in the rue Fabert, lay that note of contrast that is bound into the
very atmosphere of Paris&mdash;the note that touches the
imagination to so acute an interest. Here shabby, broken-down shops
rubbed shoulders with fine old entries, entries that savored of
other times in the hint of roomy court-yard and green garden to be
caught behind their gateways; here were creameries that conjured
the country to the eager senses, and laundries that exhaled a very
aroma of work in the hot steam that poured through their windows
and in the babble of voices that arose from the women who stood
side by side, iron in hand, bending over the long, spotless tables
piled with linen.</p>
<p>It was a touch of Parisian life, small in itself, but subtle and
suggestive as the premonition of spring awakened by the twittering
of the sparrows in the tall, leafless trees, and the throbbing song
of a caged canary that floated down from a window above a shop. It
was suggestive of that Parisian life that is as restless as the
sea, as uncontrollable, as possessed of hidden currents.</p>
<p>Involuntarily the boy paused and glanced up at the bird in its
cage&mdash;the bird that, regardless of the garden of greenstuffs
pushed through its bars, was pouring forth its heart to the pale
sun in a frenzy of worship.</p>
<p>"How strange that is!" he said. "If I were a bird and saw the
great sky, knowing myself imprisoned, I should beat my life out
against my cage."</p>
<p>The Irishman looked down upon him. "I wonder!" he said,
slowly.</p>
<p>The quick, gray eyes flashed up to his. "You doubt it?"</p>
<p>"I don't know! 'On my soul, I don't know!"</p>
<p>"Would you not beat your life out against a cage?"</p>
<p>"I wonder that too! I'd like to think I would, but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You imagine you would hesitate? You think you would
shrink?"</p>
<p>"I don't know! Human nature is so damnably patient. Come along!
here's the place we're looking for." He drew the boy across the
road to the doorway of a little <i>caf&eacute;</i>, over the door
of which hung the somewhat pretentious sign Maison Gustav.</p>
<p>The Maison Gustav was scarcely a more appetizing place than the
H&ocirc;tel Railleux. One-half of its interior was partitioned off
and filled with long tables, at which, earlier in the day, workmen
were served with <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, while the other and
smaller portion, reserved for more fastidious guests, was fitted
with a counter, ranged with fruit and cakes, and with half a dozen
round marble-topped tables, provided with chairs.</p>
<p>This more refined portion of the <i>caf&eacute;</i> was empty of
customers as the two entered. With the ease and decision of an
<i>habitu&eacute;</i>, the Irishman chose the table nearest to the
counter, and presently a woman appeared from some inner region,
and, approaching her customers, eyed them with that mixture of
shrewd observation and polite welcome that belongs to the
Frenchwoman who follows the ways of commerce.</p>
<p>"Good-day, messieurs!" She inclined her head to one side like a
plump and speculative bird, and her hands began mechanically to
smooth her black alpaca apron.</p>
<p>"Good-day, madame!" The Irishman rose and took off his hat with
a flourish that was essentially flattering.</p>
<p>The bright little eyes of the <i>Parisienne</i> sparkled, and
her round face relaxed into the inevitable smile.</p>
<p>'What could she have the pleasure of offering monsieur? It was
late, but she had an excellent <i>rago&ucirc;t</i>, now a little
cold, perhaps, but capable in an instant&mdash;'</p>
<p>The stranger put up his hand. "Madame, we could not think of
giving you the trouble&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Monsieur, a pleasure&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, madame, it is past the hour of <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>. All
we need is your charming hospitality and two cups of coffee."</p>
<p>'Coffee! But certainly! While monsieur was saying the word it
would be made and served.'</p>
<p>Madame hurried off, and in silence the Irishman took out his
cigarette-case and offered it to the boy. Bare and even cold as the
<i>caf&eacute;</i> was, there was a certain sense of shelter in the
closed glass door, in the blue film of cigarette smoke that
presently began to mount upward toward the ceiling, and in the
pleasant smell of coffee borne to them from unseen regions mingling
with the shrill, cheerful tones of their hostess's voice.</p>
<p>"A wonderful place, Paris, when all's said and done!" murmured
the Irishman, drawing in a long, luxurious breath of smoke. "How an
English restaurant-keeper would stare you out of countenance if you
demanded a modest cup of coffee when he had luncheon for you to
eat! But here, bless you, they acknowledge the rights of man. If
you want coffee, coffee you must have&mdash;and that with the best
grace in the world, lest your self-esteem be hurt! They're like my
people at home: consideration for the individual is the first
thing. It means nothing, a Saxon will tell you, and probably he's
quite right; but I'd sooner have a pleasant-spoken sinner any day
than a disagreeable saint. Ah, here comes madame!" The last words
he added in French, and the boy watched him in amused wonder as he
jumped to his feet and, meeting their hostess at the kitchen door,
insisted upon taking the tray from her hands.</p>
<p>Laughing, excited, and flattered, the little woman followed him
to the table.</p>
<p>'It was really too much! Monsieur was too kind!'</p>
<p>'On the contrary! It was not meant that woman should wait upon
man! Madame had accomplished her share in making this most
excellent coffee!'</p>
<p>He sniffed at the steaming pot with the air of a
connoisseur.</p>
<p>Madame laughed again, this time self-consciously. 'Well, her
coffee had been spoken of before now! Monsieur, her husband, who
was quite a <i>gourmet</i>&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Always declared there was no such coffee in all Paris! Was not
that so?'</p>
<p>Madame's laugh was now a gurgle of delight. 'How clever of
monsieur! Yes, it was what he said.'</p>
<p>'Of course it was! And now, how was this good husband? And how
was life treating them both?' He put the questions with deep
solicitude as he poured out the coffee, and madame, standing by the
table and smoothing her apron, grew serious, and before she was
aware was pouring forth the grievance that at the moment was
darkening her existence&mdash;the disappointment that had befallen
the Maison Gustav when her father-in-law, a market gardener near
Issy, who had a nice little sum of money laid by, had married again
at the age of sixty-four.</p>
<p>'Could monsieur conceive anything more grotesque? An old man of
sixty-four marrying a young woman of twenty! Of course there would
be a child!' Her shoulders went up, her hands went out in
expressive gesture. 'And her little L&eacute;on would be cheated of
his grandfather's money by this creature who&mdash;'</p>
<p>At this juncture the sound of a kettle boiling over brought the
story to an abrupt end, and madame flew off, leaving her guests to
a not unwelcome solitude.</p>
<p>As her black skirt whisked round the corner of the door the boy
looked at his companion.</p>
<p>"You come here often," he said.</p>
<p>The other laughed. "I've never set foot in the place before.
It's a way we Irish have of putting our fingers into other people's
pies! Some call it intrusion"&mdash;he glanced quizzically at the
boy&mdash;"but these good creatures understand it. They're more
human than the Saxon or the&mdash;" Again a glint of humor crossed
his face, as he paused on his unfinished sentence.</p>
<p>The boy reddened and impulsively leaned across the table.</p>
<p>"You have taught me something, monsieur," he said, shyly, "and I
have much to learn."</p>
<p>The other returned the glance seriously, intently. "What is it I
have taught you?"</p>
<p>"That in the smaller ways of life it is not possible to stand
quite alone."</p>
<p>The Irishman laid down his cigarette. With native quickness of
comprehension, the spirit of banter dropped from him, his mood
merged into the boy's mood.</p>
<p>"No," he said, "we are not meant to stand quite alone, and when
two of us are flung up against each other as we have been flung, by
a wave of circumstance, you may take it that the gods control the
currents. In our case I would say, 'Let's bow to the inevitable!
Let's be friends!'" He put out his hand and took the boy's strong,
slim fingers in his grasp.</p>
<p>"I don't want your secret," he added, with a quickening
interest, "but I want to know one thing. Tell me what you are
seeking here in Paris? Is it pleasure, or money, or what?"</p>
<p>He watched the boy's mobile face as he put his question: he saw
it swept by emotion, transfigured as if by some inner light; then
the hand in his trembled a little, and the gray eyes with their
flecks of gold were lifted to his own, giving insight into the
hidden soul.</p>
<p>"I want more than pleasure, monsieur&mdash;more than money," he
said. "I want first life&mdash;and then fame."</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_VII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">IT trembled and hung upon the air&mdash;that
brief word "fame"&mdash;as it has so often hung and trembled in the
streets and in the <i>caf&eacute;s</i> of Paris, winged with the
exuberance of youth, the faith in his mystic star that abides in
the heart of the artist. In that moment of confession the
individuality of the boy was submerged in his ambition; he belonged
to no country, to no sex. He was inspiration made
manifest&mdash;the flame fanned into being by the winds of the
universe, blown as those winds listed.</div>
<p>The Irishman looked into his burning face, and a curious
unnamable feeling thrilled him&mdash;a sense of enthusiasm, of
profound sadness, of poignant envy.</p>
<p>"You're not only seeking the greatest thing in the world," he
said, slowly, "but the cruellest. Failure may be cruel, but success
is crueller still. The gods are usurers, you know; they lend to
mortals, but they exact a desperate interest."</p>
<p>The boy's hand, still lying unconsciously in his, trembled
again.</p>
<p>"I know that; but it does not frighten me."</p>
<p>"A challenge? Take care! The gods are always listening."</p>
<p>"I know that. I am not afraid."</p>
<p>"So be it, then! I'll watch the duel. But what road do you
follow&mdash;music? literature? Art of some sort, of course; you
are artist all over."</p>
<p>Again the fire leaped to the boy's eyes. He snatched his hand
away in quick excitement.</p>
<p>"Look! I will show you!"</p>
<p>With the swiftness of lightning he whipped a pencil from his
pocket, pushed aside his coffee-cup, and began to draw upon the
marble-topped table as though his life depended upon his speed.</p>
<p>For ten minutes he worked feverishly, his face intensely
earnest, his head bent over his task, a lock of dark hair drooping
across his forehead; then he looked up, throwing himself back in
his chair and gazing up at his companion with the egotistical
triumph&mdash;the intense, childish satisfaction of the artist in
the first flush of accomplished work.</p>
<p>"Look! Look, now, at this!"</p>
<p>The Irishman laughed sympathetically; the artist, as belonging
to a race apart, was known by him and liked, but he rose and came
round the table with a certain scepticism. Life had taught him that
temperament and output are different things.</p>
<p>He leaned over the boy's chair; then suddenly he laid his hand
on his shoulder and gripped it, his own face lighting up.</p>
<p>"Why, boy!" he cried. "This is clever&mdash;clever&mdash;clever!
I'm a Dutchman, if this isn't the real thing! Why on earth didn't
you tell me you could do it?"</p>
<p>The boy laughed in sheer delight and, bending over the table,
added a lingering touch or two to his work&mdash;a rough expressive
sketch of himself standing back from an easel, a palette in his
left hand, a brush in his right, his hair unkempt, his whole
attitude comically suggestive of an artist in a moment of delirious
oblivion. It was the curt, abrupt expression of a mood, but there
was cleverness, distinction, humor in every line.</p>
<p>"Boy, this is fine! Fine! That duel will be fought, take my word
for it. But, look here, we must toast this first attempt! Madame!
Madame!" He literally shouted the words, and madame came flying
out.</p>
<p>"Madame, have you a liqueur brandy&mdash;very old? I have
discovered that this is a <i>f&ecirc;te</i> day."</p>
<p>"But certainly, monsieur! A <i>cognac</i> of the finest
excellence."</p>
<p>"Out with it, then! And bring two glasses&mdash;no, bring three
glasses! You must drink a toast with us!"</p>
<p>Madame bustled off, laughing and excited, and again the Irishman
gripped the boy's shoulder.</p>
<p>"You've taken me in!" he cried. "Absolutely and entirely taken
me in! I thought you a slip of a boy with a head full of notions,
and what do I find but that it's a little genius I've got! A
genius, upon my word! And here comes the blessed liquor!"</p>
<p>His whole-hearted enthusiasm was like fire, it leaped from one
to the other of his companions. As madame came back, gasping in her
haste, he ran to meet her, and, seizing the brandy and the glasses,
drew her with him to the table.</p>
<p>"Madame, you are a Frenchwoman&mdash;therefore an artist. Tell
me what you think of this!"</p>
<p>In his excitement he spoke in English, but madame understood his
actions if not his words. Full of curiosity she bent over the boy's
shoulder, peered into the sketch, then threw up her hands in
genuine admiration.</p>
<p>'Ah, but he was an artist, was monsieur! A true artist! It was
delicious&mdash;ravishing!' She turned from one of her customers to
the other. 'If monsieur would but put his name to this picture she
would never again have the table washed; and in time to come, when
he had made his big success&mdash;'</p>
<p>"Good, madame! Good! When he has made his big success he will
come back here and laugh and cry over this, and say, 'God be with
the youth of us!' as we say in my old country. Come, boy, put your
name to it!"</p>
<a name="clever"></a>
<center><img src="images/ill062.jpg" width="400" height="599" alt=
"&quot;WHY, BOY, THIS IS CLEVER&mdash;CLEVER&mdash;CLEVER!&quot;"></center>
<h5>"WHY, BOY, THIS IS CLEVER&mdash;CLEVER&mdash;CLEVER!"</h5>
<p>The boy glanced up at him. His face was aglow, there were tears
of emotion in his eyes.</p>
<p>"I can say nothing," he cried, "but that I&mdash;I have never
been so happy in my life." And, bending over his sketch, he wrote
across the marble-topped table a single word&mdash;the word
'Max.'</p>
<p>The Frenchwoman bent over his shoulder. "Max!" she murmured. "A
pretty name!"</p>
<p>The Irishman looked as well. "Max! So that's what they call you?
Max! Well, let's drink to it!" He filled the three glasses and
raised his own.</p>
<p>"To the name of Max!" he said. "May it be known from here to the
back of God's speed!" He swallowed the brandy and laid down his
glass.</p>
<p>"To M. Max!" The Frenchwoman smiled. "A great future, monsieur!"
She sipped and bowed.</p>
<p>Of the three, the boy alone sat motionless. His heart felt
strangely full, the tears in his eyes were dangerously near to
falling.</p>
<p>"Come, Max! Up with your glass!"</p>
<p>"Monsieur, I&mdash;I beg you to excuse me! My heart is very full
of your kindness."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, boy! Drink!"</p>
<p>The boy laughed with a catch in his breath, then he drank a
little with nervous haste, coughing as he laid his glass down. The
<i>cognac</i> of the Maison Gustav was of a fiery nature.</p>
<p>The Irishman laughed. "Ah, another peep behind the mask! You may
be an artist, young man&mdash;- you may have advanced
ideas&mdash;but, for all that, you're only out of the nursery! It's
for me to make a man of you, I see. Come, madame, the
<i>addition</i>, if you please! We must be going."</p>
<p>For a moment madame was lost in calculation, then she decorously
mentioned the amount of their debt.</p>
<p>The Irishman paid with the manner of a prince, and, slipping his
arm again through the boy's, moved to the door; there he looked
back.</p>
<p>"Good-day, madame! Many thanks for your charming hospitality!
Give my respects to monsieur, your husband&mdash;and kiss the
little L&eacute;on for me!"</p>
<p>They passed out into the rue Fabert, into the fresh and frosty
air, and involuntarily the boy's arm pressed his.</p>
<p>"How am I to thank you?" he murmured. "It is too much&mdash;this
kindness to a stranger."</p>
<p>The Irishman paused and looked at him. "Thanks be
damned!&mdash;and stranger be damned!" he said with sudden
vehemence. "Aren't we citizens of a free world? Must I know a man
for years before I can call him my friend? And must every one I've
known since childhood be my friend? I tell you I saw you and I
liked you&mdash;that was all, and 'twas enough."</p>
<p>Max looked at him with a certain grave simplicity. "Forgive me!"
he said.</p>
<p>Instantly the other's annoyance was dispelled. "Forgive!
Nonsense! Tell me your plans, that's all I want."</p>
<p>"My plans are very easy to explain. I shall rent a studio here
in Paris&mdash;and there I shall work."</p>
<p>"As a student?"</p>
<p>"No, I have had my years of study; I am older than you think."
He took no notice of the other's raised eyebrows. "I want to paint
a picture&mdash;a great picture. I am seeking the idea."</p>
<p>"Good! Good! Then we'll make that our basis&mdash;the search for
the idea. The search for the great idea!"</p>
<p>Max thrilled. 'The search for the idea! How splendid! Where must
it begin? Not in fashionable Paris! Oh, not in fashionable
Paris!'</p>
<p>"Fashionable Paris!" The Irishman laughed in loud disdain. "Oh
no! For us it must be the highways and the byways, eh?"</p>
<p>Max freed his arm. "Ah yes! that is what I want&mdash;that is
what I want. The highways and the byways. It is necessary that I am
very solitary here in Paris. Quite unknown, you
understand?&mdash;quite unnoticed."</p>
<p>"The mystery? I understand. And now, tell me, shall it be the
highways or the byways&mdash;Montmartre or the Quartier Latin?"</p>
<p>Max smiled decisively. "Montmartre."</p>
<p>"You know Montmartre?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>The Irishman laughed again. "Good!" he cried. "You're a fine
adventurer! You have the right spirit! Always know your own mind,
whatever else you're ignorant about! But I ought to tell you that
Montmartre swarms with your needy fellow-countrymen."</p>
<p>The boy looked up. "My needy fellow-countrymen will not harm
me&mdash;or know me."</p>
<p>"Good again! Then the coast is clear! I only thought to warn
you."</p>
<p>"I appreciate the thought." For an instant the old reserve
touched the voice.</p>
<p>"Now, Max! Now! Now!" The other turned to him, caught his arm
again, and swung him out into the Esplanade des Invalides. "You're
not to be doing that, you know! You're not! You're not! I see
through you like a pane of glass. Sometimes you forget yourself and
get natural, like you did in the <i>caf&eacute;</i> this time back;
then, all of a sudden, some imp of suspicion shakes his tail at you
and says, 'Look here, young man, put that Irishman in his place!
Keep him at a respectable arm's length!' Now, isn't that gospel
truth?"</p>
<p>The boy laughed, vanquished. "Monsieur," he said, na&iuml;vely,
"I will not do it again."</p>
<p>"That's right! You see, I'm not interesting or picturesque
enough to suspect. When all's said and done, I'm just a poor devil
of an Irishman with enough imagination to prevent his doing any
particular harm in this world, and enough money to prevent his
doing any special good. My name is Edward Fitzgerald Blake, and I
have an old barracks of a castle in County Clare. I have five
aunts, seven uncles, and twenty-four first cousins, every one of
whom thinks me a lost soul; but I have neither sister nor brother,
wife nor child to help or hinder me. There now! I have gone to
confession, and you must give me absolution and an easy
penance!"</p>
<p>Max laughed. "Thank you, monsieur!"</p>
<p>"Not 'monsieur,' for goodness' sake! Plain Ned, if you don't
mind."</p>
<p>"Ned?" The slight uncertainty, coupled with the foreign
intonation, lent a charm to the name.</p>
<p>"That's it! But I never heard it sound half so well before.
Personally, it always struck me as being rather like its
owner&mdash;of no particular significance. But I must be coming
down to earth again, I have an appointment with our friend
McCutcheon at three o'clock." He drew out his watch. "Oh, by the
powers and dominations, I have only two minutes to keep it in! How
the time has raced! I say, there's an auto-taxi looming on the
horizon, over by the Invalides; I must catch it if I can. Come,
boy! Put your best foot foremost!"</p>
<p>Laughing and running like a couple of school-boys, they
zigzagged through the labyrinth of formal trees, and secured the
cab as it was wheeling toward the <i>quais</i>.</p>
<p>"Good!" exclaimed Blake. "And now, what next? Can I give you a
lift?" His foot was on the step of the cab, his fingers on the
handle of the door, his face, flushed from his run and from the
cold, looked pleasantly young. The boy's heart went out to him in a
glow of comradeship.</p>
<p>"No, I will remain here. But I&mdash;I want to see you soon
again. May I?"</p>
<p>"May you? Say the word! To-morrow? To-night?" The cab was
snorting impatience; Blake opened the door and stepped inside.</p>
<p>The boy colored. "To-night?"</p>
<p>"Right! To-night it shall be! To-night we'll scale the heights."
He held out his hand.</p>
<p>Max took it smilingly. "You have not asked me where I live."</p>
<p>"Never thought of it! Where is it?"</p>
<p>"The H&ocirc;tel Railleux, in the rue de Dunkerque."</p>
<p>"Not a very festive locality! But sufficient for the day, eh?
Well, I'll be outside the door of the H&ocirc;tel Railleux at nine
o'clock."</p>
<p>"At nine o'clock. I shall be awaiting you."</p>
<p>"Right again! Good-bye! It's been a good morning."</p>
<p>Max smiled, a smile that seemed to have caught something of the
sun's brightness, something of the promise of spring trembling in
the pale sky.</p>
<p>"It has been a good morning. I shall never forget it."</p>
<p>Blake laughed. "Don't say that, boy! We'll oust it with many a
better."</p>
<p>He released the boy's hand and gave the address to the
chauffeur. There was a moment's pause, a rasp and wrench of
machinery, and the willing little cab flew off toward the nearest
bridge.</p>
<p>Max stood watching it, obsessed by a strange sensation. This
morning he had been utterly alone; this morning the fair, cold face
of Paris had been immobile and speculative. Now a miracle had come
to pass; the coldness had been swept aside and the beauty, the
warm, palpitating humanity had shone into his eyes, dazzling
him&mdash;fascinating him.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_VIII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">NINE o'clock found Max waiting in the rue de
Dunkerque. Paris, consummate actress that she is, was already
arraying herself for the nightly appeal to her audience of
pleasure-seekers. Like a dancer in her dressing-room, she but
awaited the signal to step forth into the glamour of the
footlights; the rouge was on her lips, the stars shone in her hair,
the jewelled slippers caressed her light feet. Even here, in the
colorless region of the Gare du Nord, the perfumed breath of the
courtesan city crept like the fumes of wine; the insidious sense of
nocturnal energy swept the brain, as the traffic jingled by and the
crowds upon the footpaths thronged into the <i>caf&eacute;s</i> and
overflowed into the roadway.</div>
<p>To the boy, walking slowly up and down, with eager eyes that
sought the one face among the many, the scene came as a joyous
revelation that called inevitably to his youth and his vitality. He
made no pretence of analyzing his sensations: he was stirred,
intoxicated by the movement, the lights, the naturalness and
artificiality that walked hand-in-hand in so strange a fellowship.
A new excitement, unlike the excitement of the morning, was at work
within him; his blood danced, his brain answered to every fleeting
picture. He was in that subtlest of all moods when the mind swings
out upon the human tide, comprehending its every ripple with a deep
intuition that seems like a retrospective knowledge. He had never
until this moment stood alone in a Paris street at night; he had
never before rubbed shoulders with a Parisian night crowd; but the
inspiration was there&mdash;the exaltation&mdash;that made him one
with this restless throng of men and women whose antecedents were
unknown to him, whose future was veiled to his gaze.</p>
<p>The sensation culminated when, out of the crowd, a hand was laid
upon his shoulder and a familiar voice rose above the babble of
sound.</p>
<p>"Well, and are we girded for the heights?"</p>
<p>It came at the right moment, it lilted absolutely with his
thoughts&mdash;the soft, pleasant tones, the easy friendliness that
seemed to accept all things as they came. His instant answer was to
smile into the Irishman's face and to press the arm that had been
slipped through his.</p>
<p>"It's too early for anything very characteristic, but there are
always impressions to be got."</p>
<p>Again the boy replied by a pressure of the arm, and together he
and Blake began to walk. The strange pleasure of yielding himself
to this man's will filtered through Max's being again, as it had
done that morning, painting the world in rosy tints. The situation
was anomalous, but he ignored the anomaly. His boats were burned;
the great ice-bound sea protected him from the past; he was here in
Paris, in the first moments of a fascinating present, under the
guardianship of this comrade whose face he had never seen until
yesterday, whose very name was still unfamiliar to his ears. It was
anomalous, but it held happiness; and who, equipped with youth and
health, starting out upon life's road, stops to question happiness?
He was the adventuring prince in the fairy-tale: every step was
taken upon enchanted ground.</p>
<p>Nothing gave him cause for quarrel as they made their way
onward. Even the Boulevard de Magenta, with its prosaic tram-lines,
its large, cheap shops, its common <i>brasseries</i> and spanning
railway bridge, seemed a place of promise; and as they passed on,
ever mounting toward Montmartre, his brain quickened to new joy,
new curiosity in every flaunting advertisement, every cobble-stone
in the long steep way of the Boulevard Barb&eacute;s, the rue de la
Nature, and the rue de Clignancourt, until at length they emerged
into the rue Andr&eacute; de Sarte&mdash;that narrow street, quaint
indeed in its dark old houses and its small, mysterious wine shops
that savor of Italy or Spain.</p>
<p>They paused, at the corner of the rue Andr&eacute; de Sarte, by
the doorway of an old, overcrowded curio shop&mdash;the curio shop
that in time to come was destined to become so familiar a landmark
to them both, to stand sentinel at the gateway of so many
emotions.</p>
<p>The lights, the shadows, the effects were all uncertain in this
strange and fascinating neighborhood. High above them, white
against the winter sky, glimmered the domes of the
Sacr&eacute;-Coeur, looking down in symbolic silence upon the
restless city; to the left stretched the rue Ronsard, with its
deserted market and lonely pavement; to the right, the Escalier de
Sainte-Marie, picturesque as its name, wound its precipitous way
apparently to the very stars, while at their feet, creeping upward
to the threshold of the church, was the plantation of rocks, trees,
and holly bushes that in the mysterious darkness seemed aquiver
with a thousand whispered secrets. There was deep contrast here to
the excitement, the vivacity of the boulevards; it seemed as if
some shadow from the white domes above had given sanctuary to the
spirit of the place&mdash;the familiar spirit of the time-stained
houses, the stone steps worn by many feet, the dark, naked
trees.</p>
<p>The boy's hand again pressed his companion's arm.</p>
<p>"What are those steps?" He pointed to the right.</p>
<p>"The Escalier de Sainte-Marie; they lead up to the rue
M&uuml;ller, and, if you desire it, to the Sacr&eacute;-Coeur
itself. Shall we climb?"</p>
<p>"But yes! Certainly!" The boy's voice was tense and eager. He
hurried forward, drawing his companion with him, and side by side
they began the mounting of the stone steps&mdash;those steps,
flanked by the row of houses, that rise one above the other, as if
emulous to attain the skies.</p>
<p>Up they went, their ears attentive to the conflicting sounds
that drifted forth from the doorways, their nostrils assailed by
the faintly pungent scent of the shrubs in the plantation. Higher
and higher they climbed, sensible with each step of a greater
isolation, of a rarer, clearer air. Above them, in one of the
higher houses in the rue M&uuml;ller, some one was playing a
fiddle, and the piercing sweet sounds came through the night like a
human voice, adding the poignancy, the passion and pathos of human
things to the aloofness and unreality of the scene.</p>
<p>The boy was the first to catch this lonely music, and as though
it called to him in some curious way, he suddenly freed his arm
from Blake's and ran forward up the steps.</p>
<p>When Blake overtook him he had passed up the rue M&uuml;ller,
and was leaning over the wooden paling that fronts the
Sacr&eacute;-Coeur, his elbows resting upon it, his face between
his hands, his eyes held by the glitter of Paris lying below
him.</p>
<p>Blake came quietly up behind him. "I thought you had given me
the slip."</p>
<p>He turned. Again the light of inspiration, the curious
illumination was apparent in his face.</p>
<p>"This is most wonderful!" he said. "Most wonderful! It is here
that I shall live. Here&mdash;here&mdash;with Paris at my
feet."</p>
<p>Blake laughed&mdash;laughed good-humoredly at the finality, the
artless arrogance of the tone.</p>
<p>"It may not be so easy to find a dwelling in the shadow of the
Sacr&eacute;-Coeur."</p>
<p>Max looked at him with calm, grave eyes. "I do not consider
difficulties, monsieur. It is here that I shall live. My mind is
made up."</p>
<p>"But this is not the artists' quarter. You may seek your
inspiration in Montmartre, but you must have your studio across the
river."</p>
<p>"Why must I? What compels me?"</p>
<p>The Irishman shrugged his shoulders. "Nothing compels you, but
it is the thing to do. You can live here, certainly, if you want
to&mdash;there is no law to forbid it&mdash;and you can find a
studio on the Boulevard de Clichy; but the other is the thing to
do."</p>
<p>The boy smiled his young wise smile. "Monsieur, there is only
one thing to do&mdash;the thing one wants to do, the thing the
heart compels. If I am to know Paris I will know her from
here&mdash;study her, love her from here. This place is one of
miracle. One might know life here, living in the skies. Listen!
That musician knows it!" He thrust out his hand impulsively and
caught Blake's in a pressure full of nervous tension, full of
magnetism. "What is it he plays? Tell me! Tell me!"</p>
<p>His touch, his excitement fired Blake's Celtic blood, banishing
his mood of criticism.</p>
<p>"The man is playing scraps from
<i>Louise</i>&mdash;Charpentier's <i>Louise</i>."</p>
<p>"I have never heard <i>Louise</i>."</p>
<p>"What! And you a student of Paris? Why, it's Charpentier's hymn
to Montmartre. Listen, now!" His voice quickened. "He's playing a
bit out of the night scene. He's playing the declaration of the
<i>Noctambule</i>:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span>"Je suis le Plaisir de Paris!<br></span>
<span class='i2'>Je vais vers les Amantes&mdash;que le D&eacute;sir
tourmente!<br></span> <span>Je vais, cherchant les coeurs qu'oubli
a le bonheur.<br></span> <span class='i2'>L&agrave;-bas glanant le

suis le Procureur de la grande Cit&eacute;!<br></span> <span>Ton
humble serviteur&mdash;ou ton ma&icirc;tre!"<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>He murmured the words below his breath, pausing as the music
deepened with the passion of the player and the sinister song
poured into the night.</p>
<p>Then came a break, a pause, and the music flowed forth again,
but curiously altered, curiously softened in character.</p>
<p>Max's fingers tightened. "Ah, but listen now, my friend!"</p>
<p>Blake turned to him in quick appreciation. "Good! Good! You are
an artist! That's Louise singing in the third act, on the day she
is to be Muse of Montmartre. It is up here in the little house her
lover has provided for her; it is twilight, and she is in the
garden, looking down upon all this"&mdash;he waved his hand
comprehensively&mdash;"it is her moment&mdash;the triumph and
climax of love. Try to think what she is saying!" He paused, and
they stood breathless and enchained, while the violin trembled
under the hand of its master, vibrant and penetrating.</p>
<p>"What is it she says?" Max whispered the words.</p>
<p>Blake's reply was to murmur the burden of the song in the same
hushed way as he had spoken the song of the <i>Noctambule</i>.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span>"Depuis le jour o&ugrave; je me suis
donn&eacute;e, toute fleurie semble ma destin&eacute;e.<br></span>
<span>Je crois r&ecirc;ver sous un ciel de f&eacute;erie,
l'&acirc;me encore gris&eacute;e de ton premier
baiser!"<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>But, abruptly&mdash;abruptly as a light might be
extinguished&mdash;the music ceased, and Max released Blake's
hand.</p>
<p>"It is all most wonderful," he said; "but the words of that
song&mdash;they do not quite please me."</p>
<p>"Why? Have you never sung that '<i>l'&acirc;me encore
gris&eacute;e de ton premier baiser</i>!'"</p>
<p>Then, as if half ashamed of the emotional moment, he gave a
little laugh, satirical and yet sad.</p>
<p>"Was there never a little dancer," he added, "never a little
model in all these years&mdash;and you so very ancient?"</p>
<p>The boy ignored the jest.</p>
<p>"I am not a believer in love," he said, evasively.</p>
<p>"Not a believer in love! Well, upon my soul, the world is
getting very old! You look like a child from school, and you talk
like some quaint little book I might have picked up on the
<i>quais</i>. What does it all mean?"</p>
<p>At the perplexity of the tone Max laughed. "Very little, <i>mon
ami</i>! I am no philosopher; but about this love, I have thought a
little, and have gained to a conclusion. It is like this! Light
love is desire of pleasure; great love is fear of being alone."</p>
<p>"Then you hold that man should be alone?"</p>
<p>"Why not?" Max shrugged his shoulders. "We come into the world
alone; we go out of it alone."</p>
<p>"A cold philosophy!"</p>
<p>"A true one, I think. If more lives were based upon it we would
have more achievement and less emotion."</p>
<p>The Irishman's enthusiasm caught sudden fire.</p>
<p>"And who wants less emotion? Isn't emotion the salt of life?
Why, where would a poor devil of a wanderer like myself be, if he
hadn't the dream in the back of his head that the right woman was
waiting for him somewhere?"</p>
<p>Max watched him seriously.</p>
<p>"Then you have never loved?"</p>
<p>"Never loved? God save us! I have been in and out of love ever
since I was seventeen. But, bless your heart, that has nothing to
do with the right woman!"</p>
<p>Max's intent eyes flashed. "And you think the right woman will
be content to take you&mdash;after all that?"</p>
<p>Blake came a step nearer, leaning over the parapet, his shoulder
touching his companion's.</p>
<p>"Boy," he said, in a changed tone, "listen to me. It's a big
subject, this subject of love and liking&mdash;too big for me to
riddle out, perhaps. But this I know, the world was made as it is,
and neither you nor I can change it; no, nor ten thousand cleverer
than we! It's all a mystery, and the queerest bit of mystery in it
is that a man may go down into the depths and rub shoulders with
the worst, and yet keep the soul of him clean for the one
woman."</p>
<p>"Don't you think there are men who can do without either the
depths or the one woman?"</p>
<p>"There are abnormalities, of course."</p>
<p>Max waived the words. "I am serious. I ask you if you do not
believe that there are certain people to whom these things you
speak of are poor things&mdash;people who believe that they are
sufficient unto themselves?"</p>
<p>The other's mouth twisted into a sarcastic smile.</p>
<p>"Show me the man who is sufficient unto himself!"</p>
<p>Swiftly&mdash;as swiftly as he had whipped the pencil from his
pocket in the <i>caf&eacute;</i> that morning&mdash;Max stepped
back, his head up, his hand resting lightly on the wooden
parapet.</p>
<p>"Monsieur! You see him!"</p>
<p>Blake's expression changed to keen surprise; he turned sharply
and peered into the boy's face.</p>
<p>"You?" he said, incredulously. "You, a slip of a boy, to ignore
the softer side of life and set yourself up against Nature? Take
that fairy-tale elsewhere!"</p>
<p>Max laughed. "Very well, my friend, wait and see!"</p>
<p>"And do you know how long I give you to defy the world, the
flesh, and the devil? A full-blooded young animal like you!"</p>
<p>"How long?"</p>
<p>"Three months&mdash;not a day more."</p>
<p>"Three months!" Max laughed, and, as had happened before, his
mood altered with the laugh. The moment of artistic exaltation
passed; again he was the boy&mdash;the adventurer, brimming with
spirits, thirsting to break a lance with life. "Three months! Very
well! Wait and see! And, in the mean time, Paris is awake, is she
not?"</p>
<p>Blake looked at the laughing face, the bright eyes, and shook
his head.</p>
<p>"I believe you're a cluricaun, come all the way from the bogs of
Clare! Come here, and take my arm again, or you'll be vanishing
into that plantation!"</p>
<p>It is unlikely that Max understood all the other's phrases, but
he understood the lenient, bantering tone that had in it a touch of
something bordering upon affection, and with a gracious eagerness
he stepped forward and slipped his hand through the proffered
arm.</p>
<p>"Where are you going to take me?" All the lightness, all the
arrogance had melted from his voice, his tone was almost as soft,
almost as submissive as a woman's.</p>
<p>Blake looked down upon him. "I hardly know&mdash;after that
philosophy of yours! I thought of taking you to a little Montmartre
<i>cabaret</i>, where many a poet wrote his first verses and many
an artist sang his first song&mdash;a dingy place, but a place with
atmosphere."</p>
<p>Max clung to his arm, the light flashing into his eyes. "Oh, my
friend, that is the place! That is the place! Let us go&mdash;let
us run, lest we miss a moment!"</p>
<p>"Good! Then hey for the Boulevard de Clichy and the quest of the
great idea!"</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_IX'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">THE ascent of the heights had been exciting, the
descent held a sense of satisfaction. At a more sober pace, with a
finer, less exuberant sense of comradeship, the two passed down the
hundred-odd steps of the Escalier de Sainte-Marie, taking an
occasional peep into some dark and silent corner, halting here and
there to glance into the dimly lighted hallway of some mysterious
house. On the upward way they had been all anticipation; now, with
appetites appeased, they toyed with their sensations like diners
with their dessert.</div>
<p>"Who are the people living in these houses?" The boy put the
question in a whisper, as if fearful of disturbing the strange
silence, the close secrecy that hung about them.</p>
<p>"The people who live here? God knows! Probably you would find a
<i>blanchisseuse</i> on the ground floor, and on the fourth a poet
or perhaps a musician, like our fiddler of <i>Louise</i>. This is
the real Bohemia, you know&mdash;not the conscious Bohemia, but the
true one, that is lawless simply because it knows no laws."</p>
<p>They had come to the end of the steps and were once again
traversing the dim rue Andr&eacute; de Sarte, the boy's eyes and
ears awake to every impression.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said in slow and meditative answer. "Yes, I think I
understand. It must be wonderful to be born unfettered."</p>
<p>"I don't know about wonderful; it's a profoundly interesting
condition. You get that blending of egoism and
originality&mdash;daring and scepticism&mdash;that may produce the
artist or may produce the criminal."</p>
<p>"But you believe that the creature of temperament&mdash;of
egoism and originality&mdash;may spring up in a lawful atmosphere
as well as in a lawless one?" The question came softly. Max had
ceased to look about him, ceased to observe the streets that grew
more crowded, more brightly lighted as they made their downward
way.</p>
<p>Blake smiled. "The tares among the wheat, eh?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Oh, of course I admit the tares among the wheat; but such
growths are mostly unsatisfactory. Forced fruit is never precisely
the same as wild fruit."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because, my boy, there is a self-consciousness about all forced
things, and the hallmark of the Bohemian is an absolute
ingenuousness."</p>
<p>"But to return to your example. Suppose the tare among the wheat
had always recognized itself&mdash;had always craved to be a tare
with other tares&mdash;until at length its roots spread and spread
and passed beyond the boundary of the wheat-field! Why should it
not flourish and lift its head among the weeds?"</p>
<p>"Because, boy, it would have its traditions. It might live
forever among the weeds, it might flourish and reign over them, but
it would have a reminiscence unknown to them&mdash;the knowledge of
the years in which it strove to mold itself to the likeness of the
wheat before rebellion woke within it. I know! I know! I know
Bohemia&mdash;love Bohemia&mdash;but at best I am only a
naturalized Bohemian. I can live on a crust with these good
creatures, or I can send my gold flying with theirs, but I'm hanged
if, for instance, I can sin in quite the delicious, child-like,
whole-hearted way that is their prerogative! I have done most of
the things that they have done, but their disarming candor, their
simple joy in their exploits, is something debarred to me. It isn't
for nothing, I tell you, that I have countless God-fearing
generations behind me!"</p>
<p>He spoke jestingly, but his glance, when it met the eager
impetuosity of the boy's, was quiet and observant.</p>
<p>"I disagree with you!" Max cried, suddenly. "I disagree with you
wholly! Individuality has nothing to do with
environment&mdash;nothing to do with ancestry."</p>
<p>"Ah, that's not logical! Humanity is only a chain of which we
are the last links forged. I have had my own delusions, when I sent
the ideal to the right-about and made realism my god, but as time
has gone on my theories have gone back on me, and tradition has
come into its own, until now I see the skeleton in every beautiful
body, and the heart of me craves something behind even the
bones&mdash;the soul of the creature."</p>
<p>"But that is different, because your desire and your theory have
been the common desire and theory&mdash;the things that burn
themselves out. My theory is not of the body, it is of the mind. I
only contend that in all the greater concerns of life I am a being
perfectly competent to stand alone."</p>
<p>"My dear boy, by the mercy of God all the ideas of youth are
reversible! My fire has been extinguished; your ice will hold until
the sun is in the zenith, and not one moment longer."</p>
<p>"I deny it! I deny it!"</p>
<p>He spoke with a fine defiance. He paused, the more convincingly
to express himself; but even as he paused, his eyes and his mind
were suddenly opened to a fresh impression, were lured from the
moment of gravity, caught and held by the lights and crowds into
which they had abruptly emerged&mdash;lights and crowds through
which the pervading sense of a pleasure-chase stole like a scent
borne on a breeze.</p>
<p>"Where are we?" he said, sharply. "What place is this?"</p>
<p>"The Boulevard de Clichy. Come, boy! Discussions are over. The
curtain is up; the play is on!" Without apology, Blake caught his
shoulder and swung him out into the roadway, as he had swung him
across the Esplanade des Invalides that morning. "Come! I'm going
to insist upon a new medicine; my first prescription was not the
right one. You're too theoretical to-night for a place of
traditions. We'll shelve our little <i>cabaret</i> till some hour
when genius burns, and instead I'll plunge you straight into common
frivolity, as though you were some Cockney tourist getting his
week-end's worth! Have you ever heard of the Bal Tabarin?"</p>
<p>"Never. And I would much&mdash;- much rather&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, you wouldn't! I have spoken. Come along!"</p>
<p>Before Max could resist he was swept across the wide roadway,
round a corner, and through what looked to him like the entrance to
a theatre.</p>
<p>There were many people gathered about this entrance: men in
evening dress, men in shabby, insignificant clothes, women in
varying types of costume. Max would have lingered to study the
little crowd, but Blake looked upon his hesitancy with distrust,
and still retaining the grip upon his shoulder, half led, half
pushed him through a short passage straight into the dancing-hall,
where on the instant his ears were assailed by a flood of joyous
sound in the form of a rhythmic, swinging waltz&mdash;his eyes
blinked before the flood of light to which the Parisian pins his
faith for public pleasures&mdash;and his nostrils were assailed by
a penetrating smell of scent and smoke. Dazed and a little
frightened he drew back against a wall, overwhelmed by the
atmosphere. Superficially there was little astonishing in the Bal
Tabarin; but to the uninitiated being with wide eyes it seemed in
very truth the gay world, with its stirring music, its walls
flaunting their mirrors and their paintings, its galleries with
their palms and railed-in boxes, and beneath&mdash;subtly
suggestive adjunct&mdash;- the bars, with their countless bottles
of champagne, bottles of every conceivable size built up in serried
rows as though Venus would raise an altar to Bacchus.</p>
<p>Leaning back against the wall, Max surveyed the scene,
fascinated and confused. A thousand questions rose to his lips, but
not one found utterance. Again and yet again his bright glance
ranged from the gay red of the bandsmen's coats to the lines of
spectators sitting at the little tables under the galleries,
returning inevitably and persistently to the pivot of the
scene&mdash;a space of pale-colored, waxed floor in the centre of
the hall, where innumerable couples whirled or glided to the tune
of the waltz.</p>
<p>He had seen many a ball in progress, but never had he seen
dancing as he saw it here, where grace rubbed shoulders with
absolute <i>gaucherie</i>, and wild hilarity mingled unashamed with
a curious seriousness&mdash;one had almost said iciness&mdash;of
demeanor. The women, who formed the definite interest of the
picture, were for the most part young, with a youth that lent
slimness and suppleness to the figure and permeated through the
freely used paint and powder like some unpurchasable essence. Among
this crowd of women some were fair, some brown, a few red-haired,
but the vast majority belonged to the type that was to become
familiar to Max as the true <i>Montmartroise</i>&mdash;the girl
possessed of the dead white face, the red, sensual lips, the
imperfectly chiselled nose, attractive in its very imperfection,
and the eyes&mdash;black, brown, or gray&mdash;that see in a single
glance to the bottom of a man's soul. Richness of apparel was not
conspicuous among them, but all wore their clothes with the sense
of fitness that possesses the <i>Parisienne</i>. Each head was held
at the angle that best displayed the well-dressed hair and cleverly
trimmed hat; each light skirt was held waist-high with a dexterity
that allowed the elaborate petticoat to sweep out from the neat
ankles in a whirl of lace.</p>
<p>Some of these girls danced with pleasure-seeking young
Englishmen or Americans in conventional evening dress, others with
little clerks in ill-fitting clothes and bowler hats, while many
chose each other for partners, and glided over the waxed floor in a
perfection of motion difficult to excel.</p>
<p>Leaning back against the wall, he watched the picture, gaining
courage with familiarity, and unconsciously a little gasp of regret
parted his lips as the waltz crashed to a finish and the dancers
moved in a body toward the tables and the bars. Then for the first
time he remembered Blake, and, looking round, saw his green eyes
fixed upon him in a quizzical, satirical glance.</p>
<p>"Well, the devil has a pleasant way with him, there's no denying
it! Come and find a seat! The next will be one of the special
dances&mdash;a <i>can-can</i> or a Spanish dance. I'd like you to
see it."</p>
<p>"Who will dance it?"</p>
<p>"Who? Oh, probably, if it's the <i>can-can,</i> half a dozen of
the best-looking of those girls with the elaborate <i>lingerie</i>.
They're paid to dance here. They're part of the show."</p>
<p>"I see!" Max was interested, but his voice did not sound very
certain. "And the others?" he added. "That fair girl, for example,
sitting at the table with the hideous, untidy little man in the
brown suit?"</p>
<p>Blake's eyes sought out the couple. "What! The two smiling into
each other's eyes? Those, my boy, are true citizens of the true
Bohemia. She is probably a little dressmaker's assistant, whose
whole available capital is sunk in that Pierrot hat and those
pretty shoes; and he&mdash;well, he might be anything with that
queer, clever head! But he's probably a poet, in the guise of a
journalist, picking up a few francs when he can and where he can. A
precarious existence, but lived in Elysium! Wish I were
twenty&mdash;and unanalytical! Come along! It's to be a Spanish
dance. You mustn't miss it!"</p>
<p>They made their way forward, pushing toward the open space, upon
which a shaft of limelight had been thrown, the better to display
the faces and figures of eight Spanish women who, dressed in their
national costume, stood preening themselves like vain birds,
tossing their heads and showing their white teeth in sudden smiles
of recognition to their friends among the audience. While Max's
interested eyes were travelling from one face to another, the
signal was given, and with an electric spontaneity the dance began.
It was a wonderful dance&mdash;a dance of sensuous contortion
crossed and arrested at every moment by the fierce flash of pride,
the swift gesture of contempt indicative of the land that had
conceived it&mdash;a dance that would diminish to the merest sway
of the body accompanied by the slow, hypnotic enticement of
half-closed eyes, and then, as a fan might shut or open, leap back
in an instant to a barbaric frenzy of motion in which loosened hair
and flaming draperies carried the beholder's senses upon a tide of
intoxication.</p>
<p>Max was conscious of quickened heart-beats and flushed cheeks as
the dancers paused and the high, shrill call that indicated an
encore pierced through the smoke-laden air; and without question he
turned and followed Blake to one of the many tables standing in the
shadow of the galleries.</p>
<p>The table was packed tightly between other tables, and in the
moment of intoxication he had no glance to spare for his neighbors.
Even Blake's voice when it came to him sounded far away and
impersonal.</p>
<p>"Sit down, boy! What will you drink?"</p>
<p>"What you drink, <i>mon ami</i>, I will drink."</p>
<p>He sat down and, with a new exuberance, threw himself back in
his seat. It was a moment of bravado that reckoned not at all with
circumstance; his gesture was imperiously reckless, the space about
him was crowded to suffocation; by a natural sequence of events his
head came into sharp contact with the waving plumes of a hat at the
table behind him.</p>
<p>With volubility and dispatch the owner of the hat expressed her
opinion of his awkwardness; one or two people near them laughed,
and, flushing a desperate red, he turned, raised his hat, and
offered an apology.</p>
<p>The possessor of the feathers was a woman of thirty who looked
ten years older than her age; her face was unhealthily pale even
beneath its mask of powder, and her eyes were curiously lifeless,
but her clothes were costly and her figure fine, if a trifle
robust. At sound of the boy's voice she turned. Her movement was
slow and deliberate; her gaze, in which a dull resentment
smouldered, passed over his confused, flushed face, and rested upon
Blake's; then a light, if light it might be called, glimmered in
her eyes, and her immobile face relaxed into a smile.</p>
<p>"'<i>Allo, mon cher</i>! But I thought you had dropped out of
life!"</p>
<p>The boy, with a startled movement, turned his eyes on Blake; but
Blake was smiling at the woman with the same pleasant
smile&mdash;half humorous, half satirical&mdash;that he had
bestowed dispassionately upon the young Englishman in the train the
night before, and upon the little <i>caf&eacute;</i> proprietress
of the rue Fabert&mdash;the smile that all his life had been a
passport to the world's byways.</p>
<p>"What! you, Lize!" he was saying easily, and with only the
faintest shadow of surprise. "Well, if I have been dead, I am now
resurrected! Let's toast old times, since you are alone.
<i>Gar&ccedil;on! Gar&ccedil;on!</i>"</p>
<p>Out of the crowd a waiter answered his call. Wine was brought,
three glasses were brought and filled, while Max watched the
performance&mdash;watched the ease and naturalness of it with
absorbed wonder.</p>
<p>"Lize," said Blake, as the waiter disappeared, "my friend who
dared to interfere with that marvellous hat is called Max. Won't
you smile upon him?"</p>
<p>Max blushed again, he could not have told why, and the lady
smiled&mdash;a vague, detached smile.</p>
<p>"A pretty boy!" she said. "He ought to have been a woman." Then,
sensible of having discharged her duty, she turned again to
Blake.</p>
<p>"And the world, <i>mon cher</i>? It has been kind to you?"</p>
<p>Blake laughed and drank some of his wine. "Oh, I can't complain!
If it isn't quite the same world that it was, the fault's in me.
I'm getting old, Lize! Eight-and-thirty come next March!"</p>
<p>A palpable chill touched the woman; she shivered, then laughed a
little hysterically, and finished her wine.</p>
<p>"Ssh! Ssh! Don't say such things!"</p>
<p>Blake refilled her glass. "I was jesting. A man is as old as he
feels; a woman&mdash;" He lifted his own glass and smiled into her
eyes with a certain kindliness of understanding. "Come, Lize! The
old times aren't so far behind us! 'Twas only yesterday that
Jacques Aujet painted you as the Bacchante in his 'Masque of
Folly.' Do you remember how angry you were when he used to kiss
you, and the grape juice used to run into your hair and down your
neck? Why, 'twas hardly yesterday!"</p>
<p>The woman looked down, and for a moment a shadow seemed to rest
upon her&mdash;a something tangible and even fearful, that lent to
her mask-like face a momentary humanity.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon ami</i>," she said, in a toneless voice, "do you
remember that Jacques is ten years dead?"</p>
<p>Then suddenly, as if fleeing from her own fear, she looked up
again, surfeiting her senses with the crowds, the lights, the smoke
and scent and crashing music.</p>
<p>"But what folly!" she cried. "Life goes on! The same round, is
it not so? Life and love and jealousy! Come, little monsieur, what
have you to say?"</p>
<p>She turned to Max, sitting silent and attentive; but even as she
turned, there was a flutter of interest among the tables behind
her, and a young girl ran up, laying her hand upon her arm.</p>
<p>"Lize!" she said, with a little gasp. "Lize! He is
here&mdash;and I am afraid."</p>
<p>Max looked up. It was the girl he had pointed out to Blake as
sitting at the table with the ugly, clever-looking man; and his
eyes opened wide in fresh surprise, fresh interest as he studied
the details of her appearance. She was of that most attractive
type, the fair <i>Parisienne</i>; her complexion was of wax-like
paleness, her blonde hair broke into little waves and tendrils
under her Pierrot hat, while her eyes, clear and blue, proclaimed
her extreme youth. As she stood now, clinging to the elder woman's
arm, her mind showed itself in an utter naturalness, an utter
disregard of the fact that she was observed. Max remembered Blake's
words&mdash;"These are true citizens of the true Bohemia."</p>
<p>But the woman Lize had turned at her cry, and laid a plump,
jewelled hand over her slim, nervous fingers.</p>
<p>"Jacqueline! My child, what is wrong?"</p>
<p>"He is here! And Lucien is here! And I am afraid!"</p>
<p>The words were vague, but the elder woman asked for no
explanation.</p>
<p>"Does Lucien know?"</p>
<p>The girl shook her head.</p>
<p>"And this beast&mdash;where is he?"</p>
<p>The girl, silent from emotional excitement, nodded toward the
opposite bar, and a light flickered up into Lize's eyes as she
scanned the crowd divided from them by the space of waxed floor,
from which the Spanish dancers had just retreated.</p>
<p>Max raised his glass and drank some of his champagne. His first
dread of the place was gripping him again&mdash;exciting him,
confusing him. All about him, like the scent-laden atmosphere
itself, moved the crowd&mdash;the girls of Montmartre and their
cavaliers. Everywhere was that sense of conscious
enjoyment&mdash;that grasping of the mere moment that the Parisian
has reduced to a science. It enveloped him like a veil&mdash;the
artless artificiality of Paris! Everywhere fans emblazoned with the
words Bal Tabarin fluttered like butterflies, everywhere cigar
smoke mingled with the essences from the women's clothes, but
beneath it all lurked a something unanalyzed, dimly understood,
that chained his imagination. It hung about him; it crouched behind
the women's expectant eyes; then suddenly it sprang forth like an
ugly beast into a perfumed garden.</p>
<p>It came in a moment: a little scuffle at the bar opposite, as a
heavy, fair-bearded man disengaged himself from the crowd about
him, a little flutter of interest as he made an unsteady way across
the waxed floor, a little smothered scream from the girl as he
lurched up to the table and paused, gazing at her with angry,
bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>For a second of silence the two looked at each other&mdash;the
girl with a frightened, fascinated gaze, the man with the slow
insolence that drink induces. At last, muttering some words in a
guttural tongue unknown to the boy, he swayed forward and laid a
heavy red hand upon her shoulder.</p>
<p>The gesture was brutal, masterful, expressive. A sense of mental
sickness seized upon Max; while the woman Lize suddenly braced
herself, changing from the inert, half-hypnotized creature of a
moment before into a being of fury.</p>
<p>"<i>Sapristi</i>!" she cried aloud. "A pretty lover to come
wooing!" And she added a phrase that had never found place in Max's
vocabulary, and at which the surrounding people laughed.</p>
<p>The words and the laugh were tow to the fire of the man's rage.
He freed the girl's arm and struck the table with a resounding
violence that made the glasses dance.</p>
<p>It was the signal for a scene. In a second people at the
neighboring tables rose to their feet, chairs were overturned, a
torrent of words poured forth from both actors and spectators,
while through everything and above everything the band poured forth
an intoxicating waltz.</p>
<p>Max, forgetful of himself, stood with wide eyes and white,
absorbed face. He saw the climax of the scene&mdash;saw the bearded
man lean across the table and seize the girl by the
waist&mdash;saw, to his breathless amazement, the woman Lize
suddenly grasp the champagne bottle and fling it full into his
face; then, abruptly, out of the maze of sensations, he felt some
one grip him by the shoulder and march him straight through the
crowd, into the vestibule, on into the open air.</p>
<p>Outside, in the glare of the lights, in the cold fresh air of
the street, he turned, white and shaking, upon Blake.</p>
<p>"Why did you do it?" he demanded. "I think you were a coward! I
would not have run away!"</p>
<p>Blake laughed, though his own voice was a little uneven, his own
face looked a little pale. "There are some battle-fields, boy,
where discretion is obviously the better part of valor! I'm sorry I
brought you here, though they generally manage to avoid this sort
of thing."</p>
<p>Max still looked indignant.</p>
<p>"But she was a friend of yours!"</p>
<p>"A friend! My God!"</p>
<p>"But she called you her friend!"</p>
<p>"Friendship is a much-defaced coin that poverty-stricken
humanity will always pass! Our friendship, boy, consists in the
fact that she once loved and was loved by a man I knew. Poor Lize!
She had a bit too much heart for the game she played. And the heart
is there still, for all the paint and powder and morphine she
fights the world with! Poor Lize!"</p>
<p>Max's eyes were still wide, but the anger had died down.</p>
<p>"And the girl?" he questioned. "The girl, and the brute, and the
man with the clever head? What have they all to do with each other
and with her?"</p>
<p>Blake's lips parted to reply, but closed again.</p>
<p>"Never mind, boy!" he said, gently. "Come along back to your
hotel; you've seen enough life for one night."</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_X'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">WITH a new day began a new epoch. On the morning
following the night, of first adventure Max woke in his odd,
mountainous bed at the H&ocirc;tel Railleux kindling to fresh and
definite sensations. In a manner miraculously swift, miraculously
smooth and subtle, he had discovered a niche in this strange city,
and had elected to fit himself to it. A knowledge of present, a
pledge of future interests seemed to permeate the atmosphere, and
he rose and dressed with the grave deliberation of the being who
sees his way clear before him.</div>
<p>It was nine o'clock when he entered the
<i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i>, and one sharp glance brought the
satisfying conviction that it was deserted save for the presence of
the assiduous young waiter, who came hurrying forward as though no
span of hours and incidents separated yesterday's meal from
to-day's.</p>
<p>His attentive attitude was unrelaxed, his smile was as
deferential as before, but this morning he found a less responsive
guest. Max was filled with a quiet assurance that debarred
familiarity; Max, in fine, was bound upon a quest, and the
submissive young waiter, the bare eating-room, Paris itself, formed
but the setting and background in his arrogant young mind to the
greatness of the mission.</p>
<p>The thought&mdash;the small seed of thought that was responsible
for the idea had been sown last night, as he leaned over the
parapet fronting the Sacr&eacute;-Coeur, looking down upon the city
with its tangle of lights; and later, in the hours of darkness,
when he had tossed on his heavy bed, too excited to lure sleep, it
had fructified with strange rapidity, growing and blossoming with
morning into definite resolve.</p>
<p>He drank his coffee and ate his roll in happy preoccupation,
and, having finished his meal, left the room and went quietly down
the stairs and through the glass door of the hotel.</p>
<p>The frost still held; Paris still smiled; and, buttoning up his
coat, he paused for a moment on the doorstep to turn his face to
the copper-red sun and breathe in the crisp, invigorating air;
then, with a quaintly decisive manner that seemed to set sentiment
aside, he walked to the edge of the footpath and hailed a passing
<i>fiacre</i>.</p>
<p>"To the church of the Sacr&eacute;-Coeur," he commanded.</p>
<p>The <i>cocher</i> received the order with a grumble, looked from
his unreliable horse to the frosty roadway, and was about to shake
his head in definite negation when Max cajoled him with a more
ingratiating voice.</p>
<p>"The rue Ronsard, then? Will you take me to the corner of the
rue Ronsard?"</p>
<p>The man grumbled again, and shrugged his shoulders until his
ears disappeared in the shaggy depths of his fur cape; but, when
all hope seemed fled, he laconically murmured the one word
"<i>Bon!</i>" whipped up his horse, and started off with a fine
disregard of whether his fare had taken his seat or been left
behind upon the footpath.</p>
<p>To those who know Montmartre only as an abode of night&mdash;a
place of light and laughter and folly&mdash;Montmartre in the day,
Montmartre at half-past nine in the morning, comes as a revelation.
The whole picture is as a coin reversed. The theatres, the
music-halls, the <i>cabarets</i> all lie with closed eyes,
innocently sleeping; the population of pleasure-seekers and
pleasure-mongers has disappeared as completely as if some magician
had waved his wand, and in its place the streets teem with the
worker&mdash;the early, industrious shopkeeper and the householder
bent upon a profitable morning's marketing. Max, gazing from the
<i>fiacre</i> with attentive eyes, followed the varying scenes,
while his horse wound a careful and laborious way up the
cobble-paved streets, and noted with an artist's eye the black,
hurrying figures of the men, cloaked and hooded against the cold,
and the black, homely figures of the women, silhouetted against the
sharp greens and yellows of the laden vegetable stalls at which
they chattered and bargained.</p>
<p>It was all noisy, interesting, alive; and us he watched the
pleasant, changing pictures, his courage strengthened, his belief
in his own star mounted higher; the decision of last night stood
out, as so few nocturnal decisions can stand out, unashamed and
justified in the light of day.</p>
<p>At the corner where the rue Andr&eacute; de Sarte joins the rue
Ronsard he dismissed his cab, and with a young inquisitiveness in
all that concerned the quarter, paused to look into the old curio
shop, no longer closed as on the previous night, but open and
inviting in its dingy suggestion of mysteries unsolved.</p>
<p>Now&mdash;at this moment of recording the boy's doings&mdash;the
curio shop no longer exists at the corner of the rue Andr&eacute;
de Sarte; it has faded into the unknown with its coppers and
brasses, its silver and tinsel, its woollen and silk stuffs; but on
that January morning of his first coming it still held place, its
musty perfumes still conjured dreams, its open doorway, festooned
with antique objects, still offered tempting glimpses into the long
and dim interior, where an old Jew, presiding genius of the place,
lurked like a spider in the innermost circle of his web.</p>
<p>Max lingered, drawn into self-forgetfulness by the blending of
faded hues, the atmosphere of must and spices, the air of age
indescribable that veiled the place. He loitered about the windows,
peeped in at the doorway, would even have ventured across the
threshold had not a ponderous figure, rising silently from a heap
of cushions upon the floor of the inmost room, sent him hastening
round the corner, guiltily conscious that it was new lamps and not
old he was here to light.</p>
<p>The interest of his mission flowed back, sharpened by the
momentary break, and it was with very swift steps that he ran up
the Escalier de Sainte-Marie to the rue M&uuml;ller; there, in the
rue M&uuml;ller, he paused, his back to the green plantation, his
face to the row of houses rising one above the other, each with its
open doorway, each with its front of brick and plaster, its iron
balcony from which hung the inevitable array of blankets, rugs, and
mattresses absorbing the morning air.</p>
<p>To say that, in the mystic silence of the previous night and
restless hours of the dawn, Max had vowed to himself that here in
the rue M&uuml;ller he would make a home, and to add that, coming
in the light of day, he found a door open to him, sounds at the
least fabulous; yet, as he stood there&mdash;eager, alert, with
face lifted expectantly, and bright gaze winging to right and
left&mdash;fable was made fact: the legend '<i>Appartement &agrave;
louer</i>' caught his glance like a pronouncement of fate.</p>
<p>It sounds fabulous, it sounds preposterous, and yet it obtains,
to be accounted for only by the fact that in this curious world
there are certain beings to whom it is given to say of all things
with na&iuml;ve faith, not 'I shall seek,' but 'I shall find.'</p>
<p>Max had never doubted that, if courage were high enough to
undertake the quest, absolute success awaited him. He read the
legend again, '<i>Appartement &agrave; louer 5i&egrave;me
&eacute;tage. Gaz: l'eau,'</i> and without hesitation crossed the
rue M&uuml;ller and passed through the open door.</p>
<p>The difference was vast between his nervous entry thirty-six
hours ago into the H&ocirc;tel Railleux and the boldness of his
step now. The difference between secret night and candid morning
lay in the two proceedings&mdash;the difference between
self-distrust and self-confidence. Then he had been a creature
newly created, looking upon himself and all the world with a
sensitive distrust; now he was an individual accepted of others,
assured of himself, already beginning to move and have his being in
happy self-forgetfulness.</p>
<p>He stepped into the hallway of the strange house and paused to
look about him, his only emotion a keen interest that kept every
nerve alert. The hallway round which he looked displayed no
original features: it was a lofty, rather narrow space, the walls
of which&mdash;painted to resemble marble&mdash;were defaced by
time, by the passing of many skirts and the rubbing of many
shoulders. In the rear was a second door, composed of glass, and
beyond it the suggestion of a staircase of polished oak that sprang
upward from the dingy floor in a surprising beauty of panelled dado
and fine old banister.</p>
<p>Max's eyes rested upon this staircase: in renewed excitement he
hurried down the hall and, regardless of the consequence, beat a
quick tattoo with his knuckles upon the glass door.</p>
<p>Silence greeted his imperative summons, and as he waited,
listening intently, he became aware of the monotonous hum of a
sewing-machine coming through a closed door upon his left.</p>
<p>The knowledge of a human presence emboldened him; again he
knocked, this time more sharply, more persistently. Again
inattention; then, as he lifted his hand for the third time, the
hum of the machine ceased abruptly, the door opened, and he turned
to confront a small woman with wispy hair and untidy clothes, whose
bodice was adorned with innumerable pins, and at whose side hung a
pair of scissors large as shears.</p>
<p>"Monsieur?" Her manner was curt&mdash;the manner of one who has
been disturbed at some engrossing occupation.</p>
<p>Max felt rebuffed; he raised his hat and bowed with as close an
imitation as he could summon of Blake's ingratiating
friendliness.</p>
<p>"Madame, you have an <i>appartement</i> to let?"</p>
<p>"True, monsieur! An <i>appartement</i> on the fifth
floor&mdash;gas and water." There was pride in the last words, if a
grudging pride.</p>
<p>"Precisely! And it is a good <i>appartement</i>?"</p>
<p>"No better in Montmartre."</p>
<p>"A sufficiency of light?"</p>
<p>'Light?' The woman smiled in scorn. 'Was it not open to the
skies&mdash;with those two windows in front, and that balcony?'</p>
<p>Max's excitement kindled.</p>
<p>"Madame, I must see this <i>appartement</i>! May I mount
now&mdash;at once?"</p>
<p>But the matter was no such light one. Madame shook her head.
'Ah, that was not possible!'</p>
<p>'Why not?'</p>
<p>'Ah, well, there was the <i>concierge</i>! The <i>concierge</i>
was out.'</p>
<p>'But the <i>concierge</i> would return?'</p>
<p>'Oh yes! It was true he would return!'</p>
<p>The little woman cast a wistful eye on the door of her own
room.</p>
<p>'At what hour?'</p>
<p>'Ah! That was a question!'</p>
<p>'This morning?'</p>
<p>'Possibly!'</p>
<p>'This afternoon?'</p>
<p>'Possibly!'</p>
<p>'But not for a certainty?'</p>
<p>'Nothing was entirely certain.'</p>
<p>Anger broke through Max's disappointment. Without a word he
turned on his heel and strode down the hall with the air of an
offended prince.</p>
<p>The woman watched him with an expressionless face until he
reached the door, then something&mdash;perhaps his youth, perhaps
his brave carriage, perhaps his defiant disappointment&mdash;moved
her.</p>
<p>"Monsieur!" she called.</p>
<p>He stopped.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, if it is absolutely necessary that you see the
<i>appartement</i>&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It is. Absolutely necessary." Max ran back.</p>
<p>"Then, monsieur, I will conduct you up-stairs."</p>
<p>The suggestion was greedily seized upon. This <i>appartement</i>
on the fifth floor had grown in value with each moment of
denial.</p>
<p>"Thank you, madame, a thousand times!"</p>
<p>"Shall we mount?"</p>
<p>"On the moment, if you will."</p>
<p>Through the glass door they went, and up the stairs, mounting
higher and ever higher in an unbroken silence. Half way up each
flight of stairs there was a window through which the light fell
upon the bare oak steps, proving them to be spotless and polished
as the floor of a convent. It was an unexpected quality, this rigid
cleanliness, and the boy acknowledged it with a mute and deep
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Upon each landing were two doors&mdash;closed doors that
sturdily guarded whatever of secrecy might lie behind, and at each
of these silent portals Max glanced with that intent and searching
look that one bestows upon objects that promise to become
intertwined with one's daily life. At last the ascent was made, the
goal reached, and he paused on the last step of the stairs to
survey the coveted fifth floor.</p>
<p>It was as bare, as scrupulously clean as were the other
landings; but his quick glance noted that while the door upon the
left was plain and unadorned as the others he had passed, that upon
the right bore a small brass plate engraved with the name 'L.
Salas.'</p>
<p>This, then, was his possible neighbor! He scanned the name
attentively.</p>
<p>"This is the fifth floor, madame?"</p>
<p>"The fifth floor, monsieur!" Without ceremony the little woman
went forward and, to his astonishment, rapped sharply upon the door
with the brass plate.</p>
<p>Max started. "Madame! The <i>appartement</i> is not
occupied?"</p>
<p>The only reply that came to him was the opening of the door by
an inch or two and the hissing whisper of a conversation of which
he caught no word. Then the lady of the scissors looked round upon
him, and the door closed.</p>
<p>"One moment, monsieur, while madame throws on a garment!"</p>
<p>A sudden loss of nerve, a sudden desire for flight seized upon
Max. He had mounted the stairs anticipating the viewing of empty
rooms, and now he was confronted with a furnished and inhabited
<i>appartement</i>, and commanded to wait 'while madame threw on a
garment'! A hundred speculations crowded to his mind. Into what
<i>milieu</i> was he about to be hurled? What sordid morning scene
was he about to witness? In a strange confusion of ideas, the white
face of the woman Lize sprang to his imagination, coupled with the
memory of the empty champagne bottle and the battered tray of the
first night at the H&ocirc;tel Railleux. A deadly sensitiveness
oppressed him; he turned sharply to his guide.</p>
<p>"Madame! Madame! It is an altogether unreasonable hour to
intrude&mdash;"</p>
<p>The reopening of the door on the right checked him, and a gentle
voice broke across his words:</p>
<p>"Now, madame, if you will!"</p>
<p>He turned, his heart still beating quickly, and a sudden shame
at his own thoughts&mdash;a sudden relief so strong as almost to be
painful&mdash;surged through him.</p>
<p>The open door revealed a woman of forty-five, perhaps of fifty,
clothed in a meagre black skirt and a plain linen wrapper of
exquisite cleanliness. It was this cleanliness that struck the note
of her personality&mdash;that fitted her as a garment, accentuating
the quiet austerity of her thin figure, the streaks of gray in her
brown hair, the pale face marked with suffering and sympathy and
repression.</p>
<p>With an instinctive deference the boy bared his head.</p>
<p>"Madame," he stammered, "I apologize profoundly for my intrusion
at such an hour."</p>
<p>"Do not apologize, monsieur. Enter, if you will!" She drew back,
smiling a little, and making him welcome by a simple gesture. "We
are anxious, I assure you, to find a tenant for the
<i>appartement</i>; my husband's health is not what it was, and we
find it necessary to move into the country."</p>
<p>He followed her into a tiny hall; and with her fingers on the
handle of an inner door, she looked at him again in her gentle,
self-possessed way.</p>
<p>"You will excuse my husband, monsieur! He is an invalid and
cannot rise from his chair."</p>
<p>She opened the inner door, and Max found himself in a bedroom,
plain in furniture and without adornment, but possessing a large
window, the full light from which was falling with pathetic
vividness on the shrunken figure and wan, expressionless face of a
very old man who sat huddled in a shabby leathern arm-chair. This
arm-chair had been drawn to the window to catch the wintry sun, and
pathos unspeakable lay in the contrasts of the picture&mdash;the
eternal youth in the cold, dancing beams&mdash;the waste, the
frailty of human things in the inert figure, the dim eyes, the
folded, twitching hands.</p>
<p>The old man looked up as the little party entered, and his eyes
sought his wife's with a mute, appealing glance; then, with a
slight confusion, he turned to Max, and his shaking hand went up
instinctively to the old black skullcap that covered his head.</p>
<p>"He wishes to greet you, monsieur, but he has not the strength."
The woman's voice dropped to tenderness, and she stooped and
arranged the rug about the shrunken knees. "If you will come this
way, I will show you the <i>salon</i>."</p>
<p>She moved quietly forward, opening a second door.</p>
<p>"You see, monsieur, it is all very convenient. In summer you can
throw the windows open and pass from one room to the other by way
of the balcony."</p>
<p>She moved from the bedroom into the <i>salon</i> as she spoke,
Max and the lady of the pins following.</p>
<p>"See, monsieur! It is quite a good room."</p>
<p>Max, still subdued by the vision of age, went forward silently,
but as he entered this second room irrepressible surprise possessed
him. Here was an atmosphere he had not anticipated. A soft, if
faded, carpet covered the floor; a fine old buffet stood against
the wall; antique carved chairs were drawn up to a massive table
that had obviously known more spacious surroundings; while upon the
walls, from floor to ceiling, were pictures&mdash;pictures of all
sizes, pictures obviously from the same hand, on the heavy gold
frames of which the name 'L. Salas' stood out conspicuously in
proof of former publicity.</p>
<p>"Madame!" He turned to the sad-faced woman, the enthusiasm of a
fellow-craftsman instantly kindled. "Madame! You are an artist?
This is your work?"</p>
<p>The woman caught the sympathy, caught the fire of interest, and
a faint flush warmed her cheek.</p>
<p>"Alas, no, monsieur! I am not artistic. It is my husband who is
the creator of these." She waved her hand proudly toward the walls.
"My husband is an artist."</p>
<p>"A renowned artist!"</p>
<p>It was the woman of the pins and scissors who spoke, surprising
Max, not by the sudden sound of her voice, but by her sudden warmth
of feeling. Again Blake's words came back&mdash;'These are the true
citizens of the true Bohemia!'&mdash;and he looked curiously from
one to the other of the women, so utterly apart in station, in
education, in ideals, yet bound by a common respect for art.</p>
<p>"It is my loss," he said, quietly, "that I did not, until
to-day, know of M. Salas."</p>
<p>"But no, monsieur! What would you know of twenty years ago? It
is true that then my husband had a reputation; but, alas, time
moves quickly&mdash;and the world is for the young!"</p>
<p>She smiled again, gently and patiently, and a sudden desire
seized Max to lift and kiss one of her thin, work-worn hands. The
whole pitiful story of a vogue outlived, of a generation pushed
aside, breathed in the silence of these fifth-floor rooms.</p>
<p>"They must be a great pride to you, madame&mdash;these
pictures."</p>
<p>"These, monsieur&mdash;and the fact that he is still with me. We
can dispense with anything save the being we love&mdash;is it not
so? But I must not detain you, talking of myself! The other rooms
are still to see! This, monsieur, is our second bedroom! And this
the kitchen!"</p>
<p>Max, following her obediently, took one peep into what was
evidently her own bedroom&mdash;a tiny apartment of rigid
simplicity, in which a narrow bed, with a large black crucifix
hanging above it, seemed the only furniture, and passed on into the
kitchen, a room scarce larger than a cupboard, in which a gas-stove
and a water-tap promised future utility.</p>
<p>"See, monsieur! Everything is very convenient. All things are
close at hand for cooking, and the light is good. And now, perhaps,
you would wish to pass back into the <i>salon</i> and step out upon
the balcony?"</p>
<p>Still silent, still preoccupied, he assented, and they passed
into the room so eloquent of past hours and dwindled fortunes.</p>
<p>"See, monsieur! The view is wonderful! Not to-day, perhaps, for
the frost blurs the distances; but in the spring&mdash;a little
later in the year&mdash;"</p>
<p>Crossing the room, she opened the long French window and stepped
out upon the narrow iron balcony.</p>
<p>Max followed, and, moving to her side, stood gazing down upon
the city of his dreams. For long he stood absorbed in thought, then
he turned and looked frankly into her face.</p>
<p>"Madame," he said, softly, "it is a place of miracle. It is here
that I shall live."</p>
<p>She smiled. She had served an apprenticeship in the reading of
the artist's heart&mdash;the child's heart.</p>
<p>"Yes, monsieur? You will live here?"</p>
<p>"As soon, madame, as it suits you to vacate the
<i>appartement</i>."</p>
<p>Again she smiled, gently, indulgently. "And may I ask, monsieur,
whether you have ascertained the figure of the rent?"</p>
<p>"No, madame."</p>
<p>"And is not that&mdash;pardon me!&mdash;a little
improvident?"</p>
<p>Max laughed. "Probably, madame! But if it demanded my last franc
I would give that last franc with an open heart, so greatly do I
desire the place."</p>
<p>The quiet eyes of the woman softened to a gentle
comprehension.</p>
<p>"You are an artist, monsieur."</p>
<p>The color leaped into the boy's face, his eyes flashed with
triumph.</p>
<p>"Madame, how did you guess?"</p>
<p>"It is no guessing, monsieur. You tell me with every word."</p>
<p>"Ah, madame, I thank you!" With a charming, swift grace he bent
and caught her hand. "And, madame"&mdash;he hesitated na&iuml;vely
and colored again. "Madame, I would like to say that when my home
is here it will be my care never to desecrate the atmosphere you
have created." He bent still lower, the sun caressing his crisp,
dark hair, and very lightly his lips touched her fingers.</p>
<p>"<i>Adieu</i>, madame!"</p>
<p>"<i>Adieu</i>, monsieur!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">IT seemed to Max, as the door closed behind him
and he found himself upon the bare landing, that he had dreamed and
was awake again; for in truth the <i>m&eacute;nage</i> into which
he had been permitted to peep seemed more the fabric of a dream
than part of the new, inconsequent life he had elected to make his
own. A curious halo of the ideal&mdash;of things set above the
corroding touch of time or fortune&mdash;surrounded the old man
forgotten of his world, and the patient wife, content in her one
frail possession.</div>
<p>He felt without comprehending that here was some precious
essence, some elixir of life, secret as it was priceless; and for
an instant a shadow, a doubt, a question crossed his happy egoism.
But the sharp, inquisitive voice of his guide brought him back to
material things.</p>
<p>"You like the <i>appartement</i>, monsieur?"</p>
<p>He threw aside his disturbing thoughts.</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly, madame!" he said, quickly. "It is here that I
shall live." Without conscious intention he used the phrase that he
had used to Blake&mdash;that he had used to Madame Salas.</p>
<p>"You are quick of decision, monsieur?"</p>
<p>"It is well, at least, to know one's own mind, madame! And now
tell me who I shall have for my neighbor." As they moved toward the
head of the stairs, he indicated the second door on the
landing&mdash;the door innocent of name, bell, or knocker.</p>
<p>"For neighbor, monsieur? Ah, I comprehend! That is the
<i>appartement</i> of M. Lucien Cartel, a musician; but his playing
will not disturb you, for the walls are thick&mdash;and, in any
case, he is a good musician."</p>
<p>A conclusion, winged with excitement, formed itself in the mind
of Max.</p>
<p>"Madame!" he cried. "He plays the violin&mdash;this M.
Cartel?"</p>
<p>"Both violin and piano, monsieur. He has a great talent."</p>
<p>"And, madame, he played last night? He played last night between
the hours of ten and eleven?"</p>
<p>"He plays constantly, monsieur, but of last night I am not sure.
Last night was eventful for M. Cartel! Last night&mdash;But I speak
too much!"</p>
<p>She glanced at Max, obviously desiring the question that would
unloose her tongue. But Max was not alert for gossip, he was
listening instead to a faint sound, long drawn out and fine as a
silver thread, that was slipping through the crevices of M.
Cartel's door.</p>
<p>"Ah, there he goes!" interjected the little woman. "Always at
the music, whatever life brings!"</p>
<p>"And I am right! It was he who played last night. How
curious!"</p>
<p>The woman glanced up, memory quickening her expression.</p>
<p>"But, yes, monsieur, you are perfectly correct," she said. "M.
Cartel did play last night. I remember now. I was finishing the hem
of a black dress for Madame D&eacute;vet, of the rue des Abesses,
when my husband came in at eleven o'clock. He walked in, leaving
the door open&mdash;the door I came through this morning at your
knock&mdash;and he stood there, blowing upon his fingers, for it
was cold. 'Our good Cartel is in love, Marthe!' he said, laughing.
'He is making music like a bird in spring!' And then, monsieur, the
next thing was a great rush of feet down the stairs, and who should
come flying into the hallway but M. Cartel himself. He paused for
an instant, seeing our door open, and he, too, was laughing. 'What
a fellow that Charpentier is!' he cried to my husband. 'His
<i>Louise</i> has kept me until I am all but late for my
<i>rendezvous</i>!' And he ran out through the hall, singing as he
went. That was all I saw of M. Cartel until two o'clock this
morning, when some one knocked upon our door&mdash;"</p>
<p>But she was permitted to go no further. The silvery notes of the
violin had dwindled into silence, and Max abruptly remembered that
he had an appointment with Blake on the Boulevard des Italiens.</p>
<p>"You are very good, madame, but it is necessary that I go! When
can I see the <i>concierge</i>?"</p>
<p>"The <i>concierge</i>, monsieur, is my husband. He will be here
for a certainty at one o'clock."</p>
<p>"Good, madame! At one o'clock I shall return."</p>
<p>He smiled, nodded, and ran down the first flight of stairs; but
by the window at the half-landing he stopped and looked back.</p>
<p>"Madame, tell me something! What is the rent of the
<i>appartement</i>?"</p>
<p>"The rent? Two hundred and sixty francs the year."</p>
<p>"Two hundred and sixty francs the year!" His voice was perfectly
expressionless. Then, apparently without reason, he laughed aloud
and ran down-stairs.</p>
<p>The woman looked after him, half inquisitively, half in
bewilderment; then to herself, in the solitude of the landing, she
shook her head.</p>
<p>"An artist, for a certainty!" she said, aloud, and, turning, she
retraced her steps and knocked with her knuckles on the door of M.
Lucien Cartel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Max finished his descent of the stairs, his feet
gliding with pleasant ease down the polished oak steps, his hand
slipping smoothly down the polished banister. Already the joy of
the free life was singing in his veins, already in spirit he was an
inmate of this house of many histories. He darted across the hall,
picturing in imagination the last night's haste of M. Cartel of the
violin. What would he be like, this M. Cartel, when he came to know
him in the flesh? Fat and short and negligent of his figure? or
lean and pathetic, as though dinner was not a certainty on every
day of the seven? He laughed a little to himself light-heartedly,
and gained the street door with unnecessary, heedless
speed&mdash;gained it on the moment that another pedestrian, moving
swiftly as himself, entered, bringing him to a sharp consciousness
of the moment.</p>
<p>Incomer and outgoer each drew back a step, each laughed, each
tendered an apology.</p>
<p>"<i>Pardon</i>, monsieur!"</p>
<p>"<i>Pardon</i>, mademoiselle!"</p>
<p>Then simultaneously a flash of recognition leaped into both
faces.</p>
<p>"Why," cried the girl, "it is the little friend of the friend of
Lize! How droll to meet like this!"</p>
<p>Her candor of speech was disarming; reticence fled before her
smile, before her artless friendliness.</p>
<p>"What a strange chance!" said Max. "What brings you to the rue
M&uuml;ller, mademoiselle?"</p>
<p>She smiled, and in her smile there was a little touch of
pride&mdash;an indefinite pride that glowed about her slender,
youthful person like an aura.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, I live in this house&mdash;now."</p>
<p>"Now?" Sudden curiosity fired him.</p>
<p>"Ah, you do not comprehend! Last night was sad, monsieur;
to-day&mdash;" She stopped.</p>
<p>"To-day, mademoiselle?"</p>
<p>For a second the clear, childish blue of her eyes flashed like a
glimpse of spring skies.</p>
<p>"It is too difficult, monsieur&mdash;the explanation. It is as I
say. Last night was dark; to-day the sun shines!" She laughed,
displaying the dazzling whiteness of her teeth. "And you,
monsieur?" she added, gayly. "You also live here in the rue
M&uuml;ller? Yes? No?" She bent her head prettily, first to one
side, then to the other, as she put her questions.</p>
<p>"I hope to live here, mademoiselle."</p>
<p>"Ah! Then I wish you, too, the sunshine, monsieur!
Good-day!"</p>
<p>"Good-day, mademoiselle!"</p>
<p>It was over&mdash;the little encounter; she moved into the dark
hallway as light, as joyous, as inconsequent as a bird. And Max
passed out into the sharp, crisp air, sensible that the troubling
memories of the Bal Tarbarin had in some strange manner been
effaced&mdash;that inadvertently he had touched some source whence
the waters of life bubbled in eternal, crystal freshness.</p>
<p>In the rue Ronsard he found a disengaged cab, and in ten minutes
he was wheeling down into the heart of Paris. It was nearing the
hour of <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, the boulevards were already
filling, and the cold, crisp air seemed to vibrate to the bustle of
hurrying human creatures seriously absorbed in the thought of
food.</p>
<p>He smiled to himself at this humorously grave homage offered up
so untiringly, so zealously to the appetite, as he made his way
between the long line of tables at the restaurant where he had
appointed to meet Blake. Like all else that appertains to the
Frenchman, its very frankness disarmed criticism or disgust. He
looked at the beaming faces, smiling up from the wide-spread
napkins in perfect accord with life, and again, involuntarily, he
smiled. It was essentially a good world, whatever the pessimists
might say!</p>
<p>From a side-table he heard his name called, and with an added
glow of pleasure, he turned, saw Blake, and made his way through
the closely ranged chairs and the throng of hurrying waiters.</p>
<p>"Well, boy! Dissipation suits you, it seems! You're looking
well. Just out of bed, I suppose?"</p>
<p>Max laughed. Words were brimming to his lips, until he knew not
how to speak.</p>
<p>"And now, what 'll you eat? I waited to order until you
came."</p>
<p>"I do not know that I can eat."</p>
<p>"God bless my soul, why not? Sit down!"</p>
<p>Max laughed again, dropped obediently into a chair, rested his
arms on the table, and looked full at Blake.</p>
<p>"May I speak?"</p>
<p>"From now till Doomsday! <i>Gar&ccedil;on</i>!"</p>
<p>But Max laid an impulsive hand upon his arm.</p>
<p>"Wait! Do not order for one moment! I must tell you!" He gave a
little gasp of excitement. "I have seen an <i>appartement</i> in
the rue M&uuml;ller&mdash;an <i>appartement</i> with a charming
<i>salon</i> opening upon a balcony, a nice little bedroom, another
room with an excellent painting light, a kitchen with water and
gas, all&mdash;all for what do you imagine?"</p>
<p>"What in God's name are you raving about?" Blake laid down the
<i>menu</i> just handed to him.</p>
<p>Max paid not the slightest heed.</p>
<p>"All for two hundred and sixty francs the year! Figure it to
yourself! Two hundred and sixty francs the year! What one would pay
in a couple of days for a suite of hotel rooms! I am mad since I
have seen the place&mdash;quite mad!" He laughed again so excitedly
that the people at the neighboring table stared.</p>
<p>"I can subscribe to that!" said Blake, satirically.</p>
<p>"Listen! Listen! You have not heard; you have not understood. I
have found an <i>appartement</i> in the rue M&uuml;ller, at
Montmartre&mdash;the <i>appartement</i> I had set my heart upon,
the place where I can live and paint and make my success!"</p>
<p>Blake stared at him in silence.</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes!" Max insisted. "And it is all quite settled. And you
are coming back with me to-day at one o'clock to interview the
<i>concierge</i>!"</p>
<p>Blake threw himself back in his chair. "I'm hanged if I am!"</p>
<p>Yesterday the boy would have drawn back upon the instant,
armored in his pride, but to-day his reply was to look direct into
Blake's face with fascinating audacity.</p>
<p>"Then you will leave me to contend alone against who can say
what villain&mdash;what <i>apache</i>?"</p>
<p>"It strikes me you are qualified to deal with any
<i>apache</i>."</p>
<p>"You are angry!"</p>
<p>"Angry! I should think not!"</p>
<p>"Oh yes, you are!" Max's eyes shone, his lips curled into
smiles.</p>
<p>"And why should I be angry? Because your silly little wings have
begun to sprout? I'm not such a fool, my boy! I knew well enough
you'd soon be flying alone."</p>
<p>Max clapped his hands. "Oh yes, you are! You are
angry&mdash;angry&mdash;angry! You are angry because I found my way
to Montmartre without you, and made a little discovery all by
myself! Is it not like a&mdash;" He stopped, laughed, reddened as
though he had made some slip, and then on the instant altered his
whole expression to one of appeal and contrition.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon ami</i>!"</p>
<p>Blake's reply was to pick up the <i>menu</i> and turn to the
attending waiter.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Ned!"</p>
<p>Blake glanced at him reluctantly, caught the softened look, and
laughed.</p>
<p>"You're a young scamp&mdash;and I suppose I'm a cross-grained
devil! But if I was angry, where's the wonder? A man doesn't pick
up a quaint little book on the <i>quais</i>, and look to have it
turning its own leaves!"</p>
<p>"But now? Now it is all forgiven? You will not cast away your
little book because&mdash;because the wind came and fluttered the
pages?"</p>
<p>Once again Max spoke softly, with the softness that broke so
alluringly across the reckless independence of look and
gesture.</p>
<p>A sudden consciousness of this fascination&mdash;a sudden
annoyance with himself that he should yield to it&mdash;touched
Blake.</p>
<p>"I can't go with you to Montmartre," he said, abruptly. "It's
McCutcheon's last day in Paris, and I promised to give him the
afternoon."</p>
<p>"Who? The long, spider man who disliked me?"</p>
<p>"A spider who weaves big webs, I can tell you! You ought to be
more respectful to your elders."</p>
<p>"And I ought to have a studio across the river? Oh, Monsieur
Ned, order some food, for the love of God! I am perishing of
hunger."</p>
<p>Blake ordered the <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, and talked a great
deal upon indifferent subjects while they ate; but each felt
jarred, each felt disappointed, though neither could exactly have
said why. At last, with a certain relief, they finished their
coffee and made a way between the long lines of tables to the
door.</p>
<p>There they halted for a moment in mutual hesitation, and at last
the boy held out his hand.</p>
<p>"And now I must wish you good-bye! Shall I see you any
more?"</p>
<p>Blake seemed lost in thought; he took no notice of the proffered
hand.</p>
<p>"Are you going to drive or walk?" He put the question after a
considerable pause.</p>
<p>"I thought to drive, because&mdash;"</p>
<p>Without permitting him to complete the sentence Blake crossed
the footpath and hailed a passing cab.</p>
<p>"Come on! In you get!"</p>
<p>Max obeyed uncertainly, and as he took his seat a sudden fear of
loss crushed him&mdash;life became blank, the brightness of the sun
was eclipsed.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Ned!" he called. "Monsieur Ned! I shall see you
again?"</p>
<p>Blake was speaking to the <i>cocher</i>. 'Rue Ronsard!' he heard
him say. 'The corner of the rue Andr&eacute; de Sarte!'</p>
<p>He leaned out of the window.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Ned! Monsieur Ned! I shall see you again? This is not
good-bye?"</p>
<p>Blake turned; he laid his hand on the door of the cab and
suddenly smiled his attractive, humorous smile.</p>
<p>"Little fool!" he said. "Didn't you know I was coming with
you?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">FROM a distinctly precarious perch&mdash;one
foot on the back of a chair, the other on an oak chest&mdash;Blake
surveyed the unfurnished <i>salon</i> of the fifth-floor
<i>appartement</i>. His coat was off, in one dusty hand he held a
hammer, in the other a picture, while from between his lips
protruded a brass-headed nail.</div>
<p>"If I drive the nail here, boy, will you be satisfied? Upon my
word, it's the last place I'll try!" He spoke with what dignity and
distinctness he could command, but the effect was lost upon Max,
who, also dusty, also bearing upon his person the evidences of
manual labor, was crouching over a wood fire, intent upon the
contents of a brass coffee-pot.</p>
<p>"Max! Do you hear me?"</p>
<p>"No, I do not hear. Take the nail from your mouth."</p>
<p>"Take it for me! I haven't a hand."</p>
<p>Max left the coffee-pot with some reluctance, crossed the room,
and with the seriousness known only to the enthusiastic amateur in
house-furnishing, removed the nail from Blake's mouth.</p>
<p>"It is a shame! You will spoil your nice teeth."</p>
<p>"What is a tooth or two in such a cause! Have you a
handkerchief?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then, for the love of God, wipe my forehead for me!"</p>
<p>Still without a smile, Max produced a handkerchief that had
obviously played the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of duster at an earlier hour
and, passing it over Blake's face, removed the dew of heat, leaving
in its place a long black streak.</p>
<p>"Thanks! I'm cooler now&mdash;though probably dirtier!"</p>
<p>"Dirtier! On the contrary, <i>mon ami</i>! You have the most
artistic scar of dust that makes you as interesting as a German
officer! Oh!" His voice rose to a cry of sharp distress, and he ran
back to the fire. "Oh, my coffee! My beautiful coffee! Oh, Ned, it
has over boiled!"</p>
<p>Blake eyed the havoc from his coign of vantage with a philosophy
tinged with triumph.</p>
<p>"Didn't I tell you that coffee-pot was a fraud the very first
day old Bluebeard tried to palm it off on us! You will never
distinguish between beauty and utility."</p>
<p>"Beauty is utility!" Max, in deep distress, was using the
much-taxed handkerchief to wipe the spilt coffee from the
hearth.</p>
<p>"Should be, my boy, but isn't! I say, give me that business to
see to!" Regardless of the picture still dangling from his hand, he
jumped to the ground and strode through a litter of papers, straw,
and packing-cases.</p>
<p>"Give me that rag!" He took the sopping handkerchief and flung
it into a distant corner. "A wisp of this straw is much more
useful&mdash;less beautiful, I admit!"</p>
<p>Max glanced up with wide eyes, extremely wistful and youthful in
expression. "I do not believe I care about either the use or the
beauty," he said, plaintively. "I only care that I am hungry and
that my coffee is lost."</p>
<p>"Hungry, boy? Why, bless my soul, you must be starving! What
time is it at all?" Blake pulled out his watch. "Eleven! And we've
been at this hard since eight! Hungry! I should think you are. Look
here! You just sit down!" He pushed aside the many objects that
encumbered the floor, and began impatiently to strip the packing
from a leather arm-chair.</p>
<p>Max laughed a little.</p>
<p>"But, <i>mon cher</i>, I prefer the ground&mdash;this nice warm
little corner close to the fire. One day I think I shall have two
cushions, like your Bluebeard of the curio shop, and sit all day
long with my legs crossed, imagining myself a Turk. Like this!" He
drew back against the wall, curling himself up with supple agility,
and smiled into his companion's eyes.</p>
<p>Blake looked down, half amused, half concerned.</p>
<p>"Poor little <i>gamin</i>! Tired and dirty and hungry. Just you
wait!" Nodding decisively, he crossed the room, opened the door
softly, and disappeared.</p>
<p>Left to himself, Max drew farther back into his warm corner and
clasped his hands about his knees. Max was enjoying himself. The
fact was patent in the lazy ease of his pose, in the smile that
hovered about his lips, in the slow, pleased glance that travelled
round and round the bare room and the furniture still standing
ghostly in its packing. It was still the joyful beginning of
things: the clean white paper upon the walls spoke of first hours
as audibly as the bunch of jonquils peeping from a dark corner
spoke of spring. It was still the beginning of things&mdash;the
salt before the sweet, the ineffable, priceless moment when life
seems malleable and to be bent to the heart's desire.</p>
<p>One month had passed since his first visit to this fifth floor;
one month since he had entered Paris, armored in his hopes; one
month since Blake had crossed his path.</p>
<p>The smile upon his lips deepened, then wavered to seriousness,
and his gaze turned from the white wall to the fire, where the
flames from the logs spurted copper and blue.</p>
<p>One month. A dream&mdash;or a lifetime?</p>
<p>Gazing into the fire, questioning his own fancy, he could scarce
decide which; a dream in the quick moving of events&mdash;the swift
viewing of new scenes; a lifetime in alteration of outlook and
environment&mdash;the severing and knitting of bonds.</p>
<p>The happy seriousness was still enfolding him, his eyes were
still intent upon the fire, when Blake entered, triumphant,
carrying a coffee-pot, and followed by a demure girl with blonde
hair and delicate pale skin.</p>
<p>"Monsieur is served!"</p>
<p>Max, startled out of his reverie, jumped to his feet.</p>
<p>"What is this? Oh, but you should not! You should not!"</p>
<p>"And why not, in the name of God? If you insist upon having
antique brass coffee-pots, your neighbors must expect to suffer,
eh, Jacqueline?"</p>
<p>The little Jacqueline laughed, shaking her fair head. "Ah, well,
monsieur, it is an art&mdash;the keeping of an
establishment&mdash;and must be learned like any other!"</p>
<p>"And you think we ought to go to school?"</p>
<p>"I did not say that!" She laid down the loaf of bread, the
butter, and the milk-jug that she was carrying, and took the coffee
from Blake's hands with an air of pretty gravity. "And now,
monsieur, where are the cups?"</p>
<p>Blake turned to Max. "Cups?" he said in English. "I know we
bought something quite unique in the matter of cups, but where the
deuce we put them&mdash;For the love of God and the honor of the
family, boy, tell me where they are!"</p>
<p>Max's eyes were shining. "They are in the chest, <i>mon
cher</i>. We put them there for safety as we went out last
night."</p>
<p>"Good! Give me the key."</p>
<p>"The key, <i>mon ami</i>, I have left at the H&ocirc;tel
Railleux!"</p>
<p>Consternation spread over Blake's face, then he burst out
laughing and turned to Jacqueline, relapsing into French.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Max would have you to know, mademoiselle, that he
possesses an altogether unusual and superior set of Oriental china,
which he bought from a certain villanous Jew at the corner of the
rue Andr&eacute; de Sarte; that for safety he has locked that china
into the artistic and musty dower-chest standing against the wall;
and that for greater safety he has forgotten the key in an antique
hotel near the Gare du Nord!"</p>
<p>He laughed again; Max laughed; the little Jacqueline laughed,
and ran to the door.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>la! la</i>! What a pair of children!" She flitted out of
the room, returning with two cups, which she set beside the coffee
and the milk.</p>
<p>"And now, messieurs, it is possible you can arrange for
yourselves!" She shot a bright, quizzical look from one to the
other. "I know you would wish me to stay and measure out the milk
and sugar, and it would flatter me to do so, but, unhappily, I have
a dish of some importance upon my own fire, and it is necessary
that one is domestic when one is only a woman&mdash;is it not so,
Monsieur Max?" She wrinkled her pretty face into a grimace of
mischief, and nodded as if some idea infinitely amusing, infinitely
profound lurked at the back of her blonde head.</p>
<p>"Good-day, Monsieur Edouard. Good-day, Monsieur Max!"</p>
<p>"Strange little creature!" said Blake, as the door closed upon
her. "Frail as a butterfly, with one capacity to prevent her taking
wing!"</p>
<p>"And that capacity&mdash;what is it?" Max had returned to his
former position, and was pouring out the coffee as he crouched
comfortably by the fire.</p>
<p>"The capacity, boy, for the <i>grande passion</i>. Odd that it
should exist in so light a vessel, but these are the secrets of
Nature! There are moments, you know, when this little Jacqueline
isn't laughing at life&mdash;rare, I admit, but still
existent&mdash;and then you see that the corners of her mouth can
droop. She may live to find existence void, but she'll never live
to find it shallow. Thanks, boy!" He took his cup of coffee, and,
walking to the table, cut a slice of bread, which he carried back
to the fire. "Now, don't say a word! I'm going to make you the
finest bit of toast you ever saw in your life!"</p>
<p>Max, preserving the required silence, watched him make the
toast, carefully balancing the bread on the tip of a knife,
carefully browning, carefully buttering it.</p>
<p>"Now! Taste that, and tell me if there wasn't a great
<i>chef</i> lost in me!"</p>
<p>He carried the toast back to the fire and watched Max eat the
first morsel.</p>
<p>"Nice?"</p>
<p>"Delicious!"</p>
<p>"Ah! Then it's all fair sailing! I'll cut myself a bit of bread
and sit down on my heels like you. There's something in that
Turkish idea, after all! But, as I was saying"&mdash;he buttered
his bread and dropped into position beside the boy&mdash;"as I was
saying awhile ago, that child next door, with all her innocent air
and her blue eyes, has climbed the slippery stairs and reached the
seventh heaven. And not only reached it herself, mind you, but
dragged that ungainly Cartel with her by the tip of her tiny
finger! Wonderful! Wonderful! Enviable fate!"</p>
<p>Max's eyes laughed. "M. Cartel's?"</p>
<p>"M. Cartel's. Oh, boy, that seventh heaven! Those slippery
steps!"</p>
<p>"And the tip of a tiny finger?" Max was jesting; but Blake, lost
in his own musings, did not perceive it.</p>
<p>"For Cartel&mdash;yes!" he said. "For me, no! I think I'd like
the whole hand."</p>
<p>Here Max picked up a tongs and stirred the logs until they
blazed.</p>
<p>"Absurd!" he said. "The tip of a finger or the whole of a hand,
it is all the same! It is a mistake, this love! That old story of
the Garden and the Serpent is as true as truth. Man and Woman were
content to live and adorn the world until one day they espied the
stupid red Apple&mdash;and straightway they must eat! Look even at
this Cartel! He is an artist; he might make the world listen to his
music. But, no! He sees a little butterfly, as you call
her&mdash;all blonde and blue&mdash;and down falls his ambition,
and up go his eyes to the sky, and henceforth he is content to
fiddle to himself and to the stars! Oh, my patience leaves me!"
Again he struck the logs, and a golden shower of sparks flew up the
chimney.</p>
<p>"I don't know!" said Blake, placidly. "I'm not so sure that he
isn't getting the best of it, when all's said and done!"</p>
<p>Max reddened. "You make me angry with this 'I do not know!' and
'I am not so sure!' The matter is like day. You cannot submerge
your personality and yet retain it."</p>
<p>"I don't know! I'd submerge mine to-morrow if I could find an
<i>alter ego</i>!"</p>
<p>"Then, <i>mon cher</i>, you are a fool!"</p>
<p>Blake drank his coffee meditatively. "Some say the fools are
happier than the wise men! I remember a poor fool of a boy at home
in Clare who used to say that he danced every night with the
fairies on the rath, and I often thought he was happier than the
people who listened to him out of pity, and shook their heads and
laughed behind his back!"</p>
<p>Max looked up, and as he looked the anger died out of his
eyes.</p>
<p>"Ned, <i>mon cher</i>, you are very patient with me!"</p>
<p>Blake turned. "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"What I say&mdash;that you are patient. Why is it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know. I'm fond of you, I suppose."</p>
<p>"I am, then, a good comrade?"</p>
<p>"The best."</p>
<p>"What is it you find in me?"</p>
<p>"I don't know! You are you."</p>
<p>"I amuse you?"</p>
<p>"You do&mdash;and more."</p>
<p>"More! In what way more?" Max drew nearer.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know! You're as amusing and spirited and generous
as any boy I've known, and yet you're different from any boy. You
sometimes fit into my thoughts almost like a woman might!" He
hesitated, and laughed at his own conceit.</p>
<p>Max, with an odd little movement of haste, drew away again.</p>
<p>"Do not say that, <i>mon ami</i>! Do not think it! I am your
good comrade, that is all."</p>
<p>"Of course you are! Sorry if I hurt your pride."</p>
<p>"You did not. It was not that." With an inexplicable change of
mood Max drew near again, and suddenly slipped his hand through
Blake's arm.</p>
<p>They laughed in unison at the return to amity, and then fell
silent, looking into the fire, watching the blue spurt of the
flames, the feathery curls of ash on the charred logs.</p>
<p>"Ned! Make me one of your stories! Tell me what you are seeing
in the fire!"</p>
<p>Blake settled himself more comfortably.</p>
<p>"Well, boy, I was just seeing a castle," he began in the
accepted manner of the story-teller, and in his pleasant, soothing
voice. "A great big castle on the summit of a mountain, with a
golden flag fluttering in the sunset; and I think it must be the
'Castle of Heart's Desire,' because all up the craggy path that
leads to it there are knights urging their horses&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Good!" Max smiled with pleasure and pressed his arm. "Continue!
Continue!"</p>
<p>"Well, they're all sorts of knights, you know," Blake went on in
the dreamy, singsong voice&mdash;"fair knights and red knights and
black knights, every one of them in glittering armor, with long
lances, and wonderful devices on their shields&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes!"</p>
<p>"&mdash;wonderful devices on their shields, and spurs of gold
and silver, and waving plumes of many colors; and the flanks of
their horses&mdash;cream-colored and chestnut and black&mdash;shine
in the light."</p>
<p>"Continue, <i>mon cher</i>! Continue! I can see them also!" Max,
utterly absorbed, charming as a child, bent forward, staring into
the heart of the fire.</p>
<p>"Well, they mount and mount and mount, and sometimes the great
horses refuse the craggy path and rear, and sometimes a knight is
unseated and the others look back and laugh at his discomfiture and
ride on until they themselves are proved unfit; and so, on and on,
while the way gets steeper and more perilous, and the company
smaller and still smaller, until the sun drops down behind the
mountain and the gold flag flutters as gray as a moth, and in all
the windows of the castle torches spring up to greet the knight who
shall succeed."</p>
<p>"And which is he&mdash;the knight who shall succeed?"</p>
<p>"Don't you see him?"</p>
<p>"No! Where is he? Where?"</p>
<p>"Why, there&mdash;riding first, on the narrowest verge of the
craggy path! A very young knight with dark hair and a proud
carriage and gray eyes with flecks of gold in them."</p>
<p>For an instant Max gazed seriously into the flames, then turned,
blushing and laughing.</p>
<p>"Ah! But you are laughing at me! What a shame! For a punishment
you shall go straight back to work." He jumped up and handed Blake
his discarded hammer.</p>
<p>Blake looked reluctantly at the hammer, then looked back at the
enticing flame of the logs.</p>
<p>"Oh, very well! Have it your own way!" he said, getting slowly
to his feet. "But if I were you, I'd like to have heard what
awaited the knight in the tapestried chamber of the castle
tower!"</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XIII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">TO the zest of the amateur, Blake added
knowledge of a practical kind in the arrangement of household gods,
and long ere the February dusk had fallen, the fifth-floor
<i>appartement</i> had assumed a certain homeliness. True, much of
the 'old iron,' as he termed the coppers and brasses for which Max
had bartered in the rue Andr&eacute; de Sarte, still encumbered the
floor, and most of the windows cried aloud for covering; but the
little <i>salon</i> was habitable, and in the bedroom once occupied
by Madame Salas a bed and a dressing-table stood forth, fresh and
enticing enough to suggest a lady's chamber, while over the high
window white serge curtains shut out the cold.</div>
<p>At seven o'clock, having torn the canvas wrappings from the last
chair, the two workers paused in their labors by common consent and
looked at each other by the uncertain light of half a dozen candles
stuck into bowls and vases in various corners of the
<i>salon</i>.</p>
<p>"Boy," said Blake, breaking what had been a long silence, "I
tell you what it is, you're done! Take a warm by the fire for a
minute, while I tub under the kitchen tap, then we'll fare forth
for a meal and a breath of air!"</p>
<p>Max, who had worked with fierce zeal if little knowledge, made
no protest. His face was pale, and he moved with a certain slow
weariness.</p>
<p>"Here! Let's test the big chair!" Blake pulled forward the deep
leathern arm-chair, that had been purchased second-hand in the rue
de la Nature, and set it in front of the blazing logs. Without a
word, Max sank into it.</p>
<p>"Comfortable?"</p>
<p>"Very comfortable." The voice was a little thin.</p>
<p>The other looked down upon him. "You're done, you know!
Literally done! Why didn't you give in sooner?"</p>
<p>"Because I was not tired&mdash;and I am not tired."</p>
<p>"Not tired! And your face is as white as a sheet! I don't
believe you're fit to go out for food."</p>
<p>"How absurd! You talk as though I were a child!" Max lifted
himself petulantly on one elbow, but his head drooped and the
remonstrance died away before it was finished.</p>
<p>"I talk as if you were a child, do I? Then I talk uncommon good
sense! Well, I'm off to wash."</p>
<p>"There is some soap in my bedroom." The voice seemed to come
from a great distance, the elbow slipped from the arm of the chair,
the dark head drooped still more, and as the door shut upon Blake,
the eyelids closed mechanically.</p>
<p>Blake's washing was a protracted affair, for the day had been
long and the toil strenuous; but at last he returned, face and
hands clean, hair smooth, and clothes reduced to order.</p>
<p>"Sorry for being so long," he began, as he walked into the room;
but there he stopped, his eyebrows went up, and his face assumed a
curious look, half amused, half tender.</p>
<p>"Poor child!" he said below his breath, and tiptoeing across the
room, he paused by the arm-chair, in the depths of which Max's
slight figure was curled up in the pleasant embrace of sleep.</p>
<p>The fire had died down, the pool of candle-light was not
brilliant, and in the soft, shadowed glow the boy made an
attractive picture.</p>
<a name="mystery"></a>
<center><img src="images/ill126.jpg" width="400" height="614" alt=
"THE IMPRESSION OF A MYSTERY FLOWED BACK UPON HIM"></center>
<h5>THE IMPRESSION OF A MYSTERY FLOWED BACK UPON HIM</h5>
<p>One hand lay carelessly on either arm of the chair; the head was
thrown back, the black lashes of the closed eyes cast shadows on
the smooth cheeks.</p>
<p>Blake looked long and interestedly, and his earliest
impression&mdash;the impression of a mystery&mdash;flowed back upon
him strong as on the night of the long journey.</p>
<p>The beauty and strength of the face called forth thought; and
Max's own declaration, so often repeated, came back upon him with
new meaning, 'I am older than you think!'</p>
<p>For almost the first time the words carried weight. It was not
that the features looked older; if anything they appeared younger
in their deep repose. But the expression&mdash;the slight knitting
of the dark brows, the set of the chin, the modelling of the full
lips, usually so mobile and prone to laughter&mdash;suggested a
hidden force, gave warranty of a depth, a strength irreconcilable
with a boy's capacities.</p>
<p>He looked&mdash;puzzled, attracted; then his glance dropped from
the face to the pathetically tired limbs, and the sense of pity
stirred anew, banishing question, causing the light of a pleasant
inspiration to awaken in his eyes.</p>
<p>Smiling to himself, he replenished the fire with exaggerated
stealth; and, creeping out of the room, closed the door behind
him.</p>
<p>He was gone for over half an hour, and when he again entered,
the fire had sprung into new life, and fresh flames&mdash;blue and
sulphur and copper-colored&mdash;were dancing up the chimney, while
the candles in their strange abiding-places had burned an inch or
two lower. But his eyes were for Max, and for Max alone, and with
the same intense stealth he crept across the room to the bare table
and solemnly unburdened himself of a variety of parcels and a
cheery-looking bottle done up in red tissue-paper.</p>
<p>Max still slept, and, drawing a sigh of satisfaction, he
proceeded with the task he had set himself&mdash;the task of
providing supper after the manner of the genius in the
fairy-tale.</p>
<p>First plates were brought from the new-filled kitchen shelves;
then knives were found, and forks; then the mysterious-looking
parcels delivered up their contents&mdash;a cold roast chicken, all
brown and golden as it had left the oven, cheese, butter, crisp
rolls, and crisp red radishes, finally a little basket piled with
fruit.</p>
<p>It was a very simple meal, but Blake smiled to himself as he set
out the dishes to the best advantage, placed the wine reverentially
in the centre to crown the feast, and at last, still tiptoeing,
came round to the back of Max's chair and laid his hands over the
closed eyes.</p>
<p>"Guess!" he said, as if to a child.</p>
<p>Max gave a little cry, in which surprise and fear struggled for
supremacy; then he sprang to his feet, shaking off the imprisoning
hands.</p>
<p>"What is it? Who is it?" Then he laughed shamefacedly, and,
turning, saw the spread table.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>mon ami</i>!" His eyes opened wide, and he gazed from
the food to Blake. "<i>Mon ami!</i> You have done this for me while
I was sleeping!"</p>
<p>His gaze was eloquent even beyond his words, and Blake, finding
no fit answer, began to move about the room, collecting the vases
that held the candles and carrying them to the table.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon ami!</i>"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, boy! It's little enough I do, goodness knows!"</p>
<p>"This is a great deal."</p>
<p>"Nonsense! What is it? You were fagged and I was fresh! And now
I suppose I must knock the head off this bottle, for we haven't a
corkscrew. The Lord lend me a steady hand, for 'twould be a pity if
I shook the wine!"</p>
<p>He carried the bottle to the fireplace, and with considerable
dexterity cracked the head and wiped the raw glass edges. "Now,
boy, the glasses! Oh, but have we glasses, though?" His face fell
in a manner that set Max laughing.</p>
<p>"We have one glass&mdash;in my room."</p>
<p>"Bravo! Fly for it!"</p>
<p>Max laughed again&mdash;his sleep, his surprise, his gratitude
equally routed; he flew, in literal obedience to the command,
across the little hall and, groping his way to the dressing-table,
searched about in the darkness for the tumbler.</p>
<p>"Ned! A candle!"</p>
<p>Blake brought the desired light, and together they discovered
the coveted glass. Max seized upon it eagerly, but as he delivered
it up a swift exclamation escaped him:</p>
<p>"My God! How dirty I am! Regard my hands!"</p>
<p>"What does it matter! You can wash after you've eaten."</p>
<p>"Oh, but no! I pay more compliment to your feast."</p>
<p>"Very well, then! We may hope to sup in an hour or so. I know
you and the making of your toilet!"</p>
<p>"Impertinent!" Max caught him by the arm and pushed him,
laughing, toward the door. "Go back and complete the table. I will
delay but four&mdash;three&mdash;two minutes in the making of
myself clean."</p>
<p>"But the table is complete&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It is incomplete, <i>mon ami</i>; it is without flowers."</p>
<p>Before Blake's objections could form into new words, he found
himself in the little hallway with the bedroom door closed upon
him, and, being a philosopher, he shook his head contentedly and
walked back into the <i>salon</i>, where he obediently brought to
light the bowl of jonquils that was still perfuming the air from
its dark corner, and set it carefully between the wine and the
fruit.</p>
<p>Ten minutes and more slipped by, during which, still
philosophical, he walked slowly round and round the table,
straightening a candle here, altering a dish there, humming all the
while in a not unmusical voice the song from <i>Louise</i>.</p>
<p>He was dwelling fondly upon the line</p>
<div class='blkquot'>
<p>"Depuis le jour o&ugrave; je me suis donn&eacute;e"&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>when the door of the bedroom was flung open as by a gale, and at
the door of the <i>salon</i> appeared Max&mdash;his dark hair
falling over his forehead, a comb in one hand, a brush in the
other.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon cher!</i> a hundred&mdash;a thousand apologies for being
so long! It is all the fault of my hair!"</p>
<p>Blake looked at him across the candles. "Indeed I wouldn't
bother about my hair, if I were you! A century of brushing wouldn't
make it respectable."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Look at the length of it!"</p>
<p>"Ah, but that pleases me!"</p>
<p>Blake shook his head in mock seriousness. "These artists! These
artists!" he murmured to himself.</p>
<p>Max laughed, threw the comb and brush from him into some unseen
corner of the hall, and ran across the <i>salon</i>.</p>
<p>"You are very ill-mannered! I shall box your ears!"</p>
<p>Blake threw himself into an attitude of defence. "I'd ask
nothing better!" he cried. "Come on! Just come on!"</p>
<p>Max, laughing and excited, took a step forward, then paused as
at some arresting thought.</p>
<p>"Afraid? Oh, <i>la, la</i>! Afraid?"</p>
<p>"Afraid!" The boy tossed the word back scornfully, but his face
flushed and he made no advance.</p>
<p>"You'll have to, now, you know!"</p>
<p>Max retreated.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, you don't!" With a quick, gay laugh, touched with the
fire of battle, Blake followed; but ere he could come to close
quarters, the boy had dodged and, lithe and swift as a cat, was
round the table.</p>
<p>"No! No!" he cried, with a little gasp, a little sob of
excitement that caught the breath. "No! No! I demand grace. A
starving man, <i>mon ami</i>! A starving man! It is not fair."</p>
<p>He knew his adversary. Blake's hands dropped to his sides, he
yielded with a laugh.</p>
<p>"Very well! Very well! Another time I'll see what you're made
of. And now 'we'll exterminate the bread-stuffs,' as McCutcheon
would say!"</p>
<p>And laughing, jesting&mdash;content in the moment for the
moment's sake&mdash;they sat down to their first serious meal in
the little <i>salon</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">THE meal was over; the candles had burned low;
in the quiet, warm room the sense of repose was dominant.</div>
<p>Blake took out his cigarette-case and passed it across the
table, watching Max with lazy interest as he chose a cigarette and
lighted it at a candle-flame.</p>
<p>"Happy?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely!"</p>
<p>He had wanted in a vague, subconscious way to see the flash of
the white teeth, the quick, familiar lifting of the boy's glance,
and now he smiled as a man secretly satisfied.</p>
<p>"I know just exactly what you're feeling," he said, as Max threw
himself back in his chair and inhaled a first deep breath of smoke.
"You feel that that little white curl from the end of your
cigarette is the last puff of smoke from the boats you have burned;
and that, with your own four walls around you, you can snap your
fingers at the world. I know! God, don't I know!"</p>
<p>Max smiled slowly, watching the tip of his cigarette. "Yes, you
know! That is the beautiful thing about you."</p>
<p>The appreciation warmed Blake's soul as the good red wine had
warmed his blood.</p>
<p>"I believe I do&mdash;with you. I believe I could tell you
precisely your thoughts at this present moment." With a pleasant,
meditative action, he drew a cigar from his case.</p>
<p>"Tell me!"</p>
<p>"Well, first of all, there's the great contentment&mdash;the
sense of a definite step. You're strong enough to like
finality."</p>
<p>"I hope I am. I think I am."</p>
<p>"You are! Not a doubt of it! But what I mean is that you've left
an old world for a new one; and no matter how exciting the voyaging
through space may have been, you like to feel your feet on terra
firma."</p>
<p>Max leaned forward eagerly. "That is quite true! And I like it
because now I can open my eyes, and say to myself, 'not to-morrow,
but to-day I live.' I have put&mdash;how do you say in
English?&mdash;my hand upon the plough."</p>
<p>"Exactly! The plough&mdash;or the palette&mdash;it's all the
same! You're set to it now."</p>
<p>The boy's eyes flashed in the candle-light, and for an instant
something of the fierce emotion that can lash the Russian calm, as
a gale lashes the sea, troubled his young face.</p>
<p>"You comprehend&mdash;absolutely! I have made my choice; I have
come to it out of many situations. I would die now rather than I
would fail."</p>
<p>In his voice was a suppressed fervor akin to some harsh or cruel
emotion; and to Blake, watching and listening, there floated the
hot echo of stories in which Russians had acted strange parts with
a resolve, a callousness incomprehensible to other races.</p>
<p>"When you talk like that, boy, I could almost go back to that
first night, and adopt McCutcheon's theory. You might feasibly be a
revolutionary with those blazing eyes."</p>
<p>Max laughed, coming back to the moment.</p>
<p>"Only revolutionary in my own cause! I fight myself for myself.
You take my meaning?"</p>
<p>"Not in the very least! But I accept your statement; I like its
brave ring. You are your own romance."</p>
<p>"I am my own romance."</p>
<p>"Let's drink to it, then! Your romance&mdash;whatever it may
be!" He raised the half-empty tumbler, drank a little, and handed
it across the table.</p>
<p>Max laughed and drank as well. "My romance&mdash;whatever it may
be!"</p>
<p>"Whatever it may be! And now for that breath of air we promised
ourselves! It's close on ten o'clock."</p>
<p>So the meal ended; coats were found, candles blown out, and a
last proprietary inspection of the <i>appartement</i> made by the
aid of matches.</p>
<p>They ran down the long, smooth staircase, and, stepping into the
quiet, starlit rue M&uuml;ller, linked arms and began their descent
upon Paris with as much ease, as nice a familiarity as though life
for both of them had been passed in the shadow of the
Sacr&eacute;-Coeur.</p>
<p>On the Boulevard de Clichy the usual confusion of lights and
humanity greeted them like welcoming arms, and with the same
agreeable nonchalance they yielded to the embrace.</p>
<p>Conscious of no definite purpose, they turned to the right and
began to breast the human tide with eyes carelessly critical of the
thronging faces, ears heedlessly open to the many tangled sounds of
street life. Outside the theatres, flaunting posters made pools of
color; in the roadway, the network of traffic surged and
intermingled; from amid the flat house fronts, at every few hundred
yards, some <i>cabaret</i> broke upon the sight in crude confusion
of scenic painting and electric light; while dominating all&mdash;a
monument to the power of tradition&mdash;the sails of the
time-honored mill sprang red and glaring from a background of quiet
sky.</p>
<p>But the two, walking arm-in-arm, had no glance for revolving
mill-sails or vivid advertisement, and presently Blake halted
before a house that, but for a certain prosperity of stained-glass
window and dark-green paint, would have seemed a common wine
shop.</p>
<p>"Max," he said, "do you remember the famous night when we went
to the Bal Tabarin, and saw much wine spilled? It was here I was
first going to bring you then."</p>
<p>"Here?"</p>
<p>"This very place! 'Tis one of the old artistic <i>cabarets</i>
of Paris&mdash;grown a bit too big for its shoes now, like the rest
of Montmartre, but still retaining a flavor. What do you say to
turning in?"</p>
<p>"I say 'yes.'"</p>
<p>"Come along, then! I hope 'twon't disappoint you! There's a good
deal of rubbish here, but a scattering of grain among the chaff.
Ah, messieurs! Good-evening!"</p>
<p>This last was addressed with cordiality to a knot of men
gathered inside the doorway of the <i>cabaret</i>, all of whom rose
politely from their chairs at Blake's entry.</p>
<p>Max, peering curiously through the tobacco smoke that veiled the
place, received an impression of a room&mdash;rather, of a
shop&mdash;possessed of tables, chairs, a small circular counter
where glasses and bottles winked and gleamed, and of walls hung
with a truly Parisian collection of impressionist studies and
clever caricatures.</p>
<p>"Monsieur is interested?"</p>
<p>He turned, to meet the eyes of the host, a stout and affable
Frenchman, who by right divine held first place among the little
group of loungers; but before he could frame a reply, Blake
answered for him.</p>
<p>"He is an artist, M. Fruvier, and finds all life
interesting."</p>
<p>M. Fruvier bowed with much subtle comprehension.</p>
<p>"Then possibly it will intrigue him to step inside, and hear our
little concert. We are about to commence."</p>
<p>Blake nodded in silent acquiescence; the knot of men bowed
quickly and stiffly; and Max found himself being led across the
bare, sawdust-strewn floor into an inner and larger room&mdash;a
holy of holies&mdash;where the light was dimmer and the air more
cool.</p>
<p>Here, a scattered audience was assembled&mdash;a score or so of
individuals, sober of dress, unenthusiastic of demeanor, sitting in
twos and threes, sipping beer or liqueurs and waiting for the
concert to begin.</p>
<p>Max's eyes wandered over this collection of people while Blake
sought for seats, but his glance and his interest passed on almost
immediately to the walls, where, as in the outer room, pictures
ranged from floor to ceiling.</p>
<p>The seats were chosen; a white-aproned waiter claimed an order,
and Blake gave one as if from habit.</p>
<p>"And now, boy, a cigarette?"</p>
<p>"If you please&mdash;a cigarette!" Max's voice had the quick
note, his eyes the swift light that spoke excitement. "<i>Mon
ami</i>, I like this place! I like it! And I wonder who painted
that?" He indicated a picture that hung upon the wall beside
them.</p>
<p>"I don't know! Some chap who used to frequent the place in his
unknown days. We can ask Fruvier."</p>
<p>"It is clever."</p>
<p>"It is."</p>
<p>"It has imagination."</p>
<p>They both looked at the picture&mdash;a study in black and
white, showing an attic room, with a <i>pierrette</i> seated
disconsolate upon a bed, a <i>pierrot</i> gazing through a
window.</p>
<p>"<i>Pierrot</i> seeking the moon, eh?"</p>
<p>Max nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes. It has imagination&mdash;and also technique!"</p>
<p>But their criticism was interrupted; a piano was opened at the
farther end of the room by an individual affecting the unkempt hair
and velveteen coat of past Bohemianism, who seated himself and ran
his fingers over the keys as though he alone occupied the room.</p>
<p>At this very informal signal, the curtain rose upon a
ridiculously small stage, and an insignificant, nervous-looking man
stepped toward the footlights at the same moment that M. Fruvier
and his followers entered and seated themselves in a row, their
backs to the wall.</p>
<p>This appearance of the proprietor was the sole meed of interest
offered to the singer, the audience continuing to smoke, to sip,
even to peruse the evening papers with stoic indifference.</p>
<p>The song began&mdash;a long and unamusing ditty, topical in its
points. Here and there a smile showed that it did not pass unheard,
and as the singer disappeared a faint <i>roulade</i> of applause
came from the back of the room.</p>
<p>Max turned to his companion.</p>
<p>"But I believed the Parisians to be all excitement! What an
audience! Like the dead!"</p>
<p>"They are excitable when something excites them."</p>
<p>"Then they dislike this song?"</p>
<p>"Oh no! 'Not bad!' they'd say if you asked them; but they're not
here to be excited&mdash;they're not here to waste enthusiasm. Like
ourselves, they have worked and have eaten, and are enjoying an
hour's repose. The song is part of the hour&mdash;as inevitable as
the <i>bock</i> and the cigar, and you can't expect a smoker to wax
eloquent over a familiar weed."</p>
<p>"How strange! How interesting!" The boy looked round the
scattered groups that formed to his young eyes another side-show in
the vast theatre of life.</p>
<p>No one heeded his interest. The women, young and elderly alike,
conversed with their escorts and sipped their liqueurs with
absorbed quiet; the men smoked and drank, talked or read aloud
little paragraphs from their papers with whispering relish.</p>
<p>Then again the piano tinkled, and the same singer appeared, to
sing another song almost identical with the first; but now his
nervousness was less, he won a laugh or two for his political
innuendoes, and when he finished Max clapped his hands, and Blake
laughingly followed suit.</p>
<p>"He's a new man," he said; "this is probably his first
night."</p>
<p>"His first? Oh, poor creature! What a <i>d&eacute;but</i>! Clap
your hands again!"</p>
<p>"Poor creature indeed! He's delighted with himself. Many a
better man has been driven from the stage after his first verse.
Your Paris can be cruel."</p>
<p>Their example had been tepidly followed, and the singer, beaming
under the relaxed tension of his nerves, was smiling and bowing
before entering upon the perils of a third song.</p>
<p>"And what do they pay him?"</p>
<p>"Oh, a couple of francs a song! The fees will grow with his
success."</p>
<p>Max gasped. "A couple of francs! Oh, my God!"</p>
<p>"What do you expect? We're not in Eldorado."</p>
<p>"But a couple of francs!"</p>
<p>"Ssh! Don't talk anarchy. Here come the powers that be!"</p>
<p>M. Fruvier was coming toward them, making his way between the
seats with many bows, many apologetic smiles.</p>
<p>"Well, messieurs, and what of our new one? Not a Vagot,
perhaps"&mdash;mentioning a famous <i>comique</i> whose star had
risen in the firmament of the <i>cabaret</i>&mdash;"not a Vagot,
perhaps, but not bad! Not bad?"</p>
<p>"Not bad!" acquiesced Blake.</p>
<p>"Very good!" added Max, pondering hotly upon the wage of the
singer, and regarding M. Fruvier with doubtful glance.</p>
<p>"No! No! Not bad!" reiterated that gentleman, as if viewing the
performance from a wholly impersonal standpoint. "Not bad!" And,
still bowing, still smiling, he wandered on to exchange opinions
with his other patrons, while a new singer appeared, a man whose
vast proportions and round red face looked truly absurd upon the
tiny stage, but whose merry eye and instant friendly nod gained him
a murmur of welcome.</p>
<p>With the appearance of the new-comer a little stir of life was
felt, and in obedience to some impulse of his own, Max took a
sketch-book and a pencil from his pocket, and sat forward in his
seat, with glance roving round and round the room, pencil poised
above the paper.</p>
<p>"I heard this fellow here twelve years ago," said Blake. "He and
Vagot were young men then. Shows the odd lie of things in this
world! There's Vagot making his thousands of francs a week next
door at the Moulin Rouge, and this poor fat clown still where he
was!"</p>
<p>Max did not reply. His head was bent, his face flushed; he was
sketching with a furious haste.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>Still no reply. The song rolled on; and Blake, leaning back in
his seat, smoking with leisurely enjoyment, felt for perhaps the
first time in his life the sense of complete
companionship&mdash;that subtle condition of mind so continuously
craved, so rarely found, so instantly recognized.</p>
<p>"Boy," he said at last, "let me come up sometimes when you're
messing with your paints? I won't bother you."</p>
<p>Max looked up and nodded&mdash;a mere flash of a look, but one
that conveyed sufficient; and the two relapsed again into
silence.</p>
<p>At the end of an hour the boy raised his head, tossed a lock of
hair out of his eyes, and closed his sketch-book.</p>
<p>Blake met his eyes comprehendingly. "Will we go?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But one more glance at this black-and-white!"</p>
<p>He jumped up, unembarrassed, unconscious of self, and looked at
the picture closely; then stepped back and looked at it from a
little distance, eyes half closed, head critically upon one
side.</p>
<p>"Satisfied?" Blake rose more slowly.</p>
<p>"Perfectly. It is clever&mdash;this! It has imagination!" He
slipped his arm confidingly through Blake's, and together they made
a way to the door.</p>
<p>A new song began as they stepped into the outer room&mdash;the
tinkle of the piano came thinly across the smoke-laden air. Blake
paused and looked back.</p>
<p>"Well, and what do you think of it? A trifle dull, perhaps, but
still&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Dull? But no! Never! I could work here. Others have worked
here. It is in the atmosphere&mdash;- the desire to create."</p>
<p>They passed into the street, Blake raising his hat to a stout
lady, presumably Madame Fruvier, who sat wedged behind the counter,
Max glancing greedily at the bold rough sketches, the brilliantly
Parisian caricatures adorning the walls.</p>
<p>"It is in the atmosphere! One breathes it!" he said again, as
they walked down the cool, lighted boulevard. "I feel it to-night
as I have not felt it before&mdash;the artist's Paris. <i>Mon
ami</i>"&mdash;he raised a glowing face&mdash;"<i>mon ami</i>, tell
me something! Do you think I shall succeed? Do you think I possess
a spark of the great fire&mdash;a spark ever so tiny?"</p>
<p>His earnestness was almost comical. He stopped and arraigned his
companion, regardless of interested glances and passing smiles.</p>
<p>"Ned, tell me! Tell me! Have you faith in me?"</p>
<p>Blake looked into the feverishly bright eyes, and a swift
conviction possessed him.</p>
<p>"I know this, boy, whatever you do, you'll do it finely! More I
cannot say."</p>
<p>Max fell silent, and they proceeded on their way, each
preoccupied with his own thoughts. At the turning to the heights
Blake paused.</p>
<p>"I'll say good-bye here! I have letters to write to-night; but
I'll be up to-morrow to spirit you off to lunch. I won't come too
early, for I know what you'll be doing all the morning."</p>
<p>Max laughed, coming back out of his dream. "And what is it I
shall be doing all the morning?"</p>
<p>"Why, carting canvases and paint tubes, and God knows what, up
those steps till your back is broken, and then settling down with
your temper and your ambition at fever heat to begin the great
picture at the most inopportune moment in the world! Think I don't
know you?"</p>
<p>Max laughed again, but more softly.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon ami!</i>"</p>
<p>"I'm right, eh? That sketch at the <i>cabaret</i> is meant to
grow?"</p>
<p>Instantly Max was diffident. "Oh, I am not so sure! It is only
an idea. It may not arrive at anything."</p>
<p>"Let's have a look?"</p>
<p>Max's hand went slowly toward his pocket. "I am not sure that I
like it; it is not my theory of life. It's more of your
theory&mdash;it is ironical."</p>
<p>"Let's see!"</p>
<p>The sketch-book came reluctantly to light, and as Max opened it,
the two stepped close to a street lamp.</p>
<p>"As I tell you, it is ironical. If it becomes a picture I shall
give it this name&mdash;<i>The Failure</i>." He handed it to Blake,
leaning close and peering over his shoulder in nervous anxiety.</p>
<p>"Understand, it is but an idea! I have put no work into it."</p>
<p>Blake held the book up to the light, his observant face grave
and interested.</p>
<p>"What a clever little beggar you are!" he said at length.</p>
<p>Max glowed at the words, and instantly his tongue was
loosed.</p>
<p>"Ah, <i>mon cher</i>, but it is only a sketch! That
atmosphere&mdash;that dim, smoky atmosphere&mdash;is so difficult
with the pencil. The audience is, of course, but suggested; all
that I really attempted was the singer&mdash;the failure with the
merry eyes."</p>
<p>"And well you've caught him too, by gad! One would think you had
seen the antithesis&mdash;Vagot, the success, long and lean and
yellow, the unhappiest-looking man you ever saw."</p>
<p>"Ah, but you must not say that!" cried Max unexpectedly. "I told
you it was not my theory. To me success is life, failure is death!
This is but a reflected impression of yours&mdash;- an impression
of irony!" He took the sketch-book from Blake's hands and closed it
sharply; then, to ask pardon for his little outburst, he
smiled.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon cher</i>! Forgive me! Come to-morrow, and we will see if
day has thrown new light."</p>
<p>They shook hands.</p>
<p>"All right&mdash;to-morrow! Good-night, boy&mdash;and good
luck!"</p>
<p>"Good-night!"</p>
<p>Max stood to watch the tall figure disappear into the tangle of
traffic, then with a light step, a light heart, a light sense of
propitiated fate, he began the climb to his home.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XV'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">THAT night the pencil-sketch obsessed the brain
of Max. Tossing wakeful upon his bed, he saw the pageant of the
future&mdash;touched the robe, all saffron and silver, of the
goddess Inspiration&mdash;and, with the brushes and colors of
imagination, gained to the gateway of fame.</div>
<p>It was a wild night that spurred to action, and with the coming
of the day, Blake's prophecy was fulfilled. Before the Montmartre
shops were open, he was seeking the materials of his art; and long
ere the sun was high, he was back in the room that had once been
the bedroom of M. Salas, surrounded by the disarray of the inspired
moment.</p>
<p>The room was small but lofty, and a fine light made his work
possible. The inevitable wood fire crackled on the hearth, but
otherwise the atmosphere spoke rigidly of toil.</p>
<p>Zeal, endeavor, ambition in its youngest, divinest
form&mdash;these were the suggestions dormant in the strewn
canvases, the tall easel, the bare walls; and none who were to
know, or who had known, Max&mdash;none destined to kindle to the
flame of his personality, ever viewed him in more characteristic
guise than he appeared on that February morning clad in his
painting smock, the lock of hair falling over his forehead, his
hands trembling with excitement, as he executed the first bold line
that meant the birth of his idea.</p>
<p>So remarkable, so characteristic was the pose that chance, ever
with an eye to effect, ordained it an observer, for scarcely had he
lost himself in the work than the door of his studio opened with a
Bohemian lack of ceremony, and his neighbor,
Jacqueline&mdash;dressed in a blue print dress that matched her
eyes&mdash;came smiling into the room.</p>
<p>"Good-day, monsieur!"</p>
<p>He glowered with complete unreserve.</p>
<p>"You are displeased, monsieur; I intrude?"</p>
<p>"You do, mademoiselle."</p>
<p>The tone was uncompromising, but Jacqueline came on, softly
moving nearer and nearer to the easel, looking from the canvas to
Max and back again to the canvas in an amused, secret fashion
comprehensible to herself alone.</p>
<p>"You feel like my poor Lucien, when an interruption offers
itself to his work; but, as I say, <i>ennui</i> is the price of
admiration! Is it not so, Monsieur Max?"</p>
<p>She leaned her blonde head to one side, and looked at him with
the na&iuml;ve quality of meditation that so became her.</p>
<p>"Do not permit me to disturb you, monsieur! Continue
working."</p>
<p>"Thank you, mademoiselle!" A flicker of irony was observable in
the tone and, with exaggerated zeal, he returned to his task.</p>
<p>The girl came softly behind him, looking over his shoulder.</p>
<p>"What is the picture to be, monsieur?"</p>
<p>"It is an idea caught last night in a <i>cabaret</i>. It would
not interest you."</p>
<p>"And why not?"</p>
<p>Max shrugged his shoulders, and went on blocking in his
picture.</p>
<p>"Because it is a psychological study&mdash;a side-issue of
existence. Nothing to do with the crude facts of life."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Jacqueline drew in her breath softly. "I am only
interested, then, in the crude facts? How do you arrive at that
conclusion, monsieur?"</p>
<p>"By observation, mademoiselle."</p>
<p>"And what have you observed?"</p>
<p>"It is difficult to say&mdash;in words. In a picture I would put
it like this&mdash;a blue sky, a meadow of rank green grass, a
stream full of forget-me-nots, and a girl bending over it, with
eyes the color of the flowers. Conventionality would compel me to
call it <i>Spring</i> or <i>Youth</i>!" He spoke fast and he spoke
contemptuously.</p>
<p>She watched him, her head still characteristically drooping, the
little wise smile hovering about her lips.</p>
<p>"I comprehend!" she murmured to herself. "Monsieur is very
worldly-wise. Monsieur has discovered that there is&mdash;how shall
I say?&mdash;less atmosphere in a blue sky than in a gray one?"</p>
<p>Max glanced round at her. He had the uncomfortable feeling that
he was being laughed at, but her clear azure eyes met his
innocently, and her mouth was guiltless of smiles.</p>
<p>"I have had a sufficiency of blue sky," he said, and returned to
his work.</p>
<p>"One is liable to think that, monsieur, until the rain
falls!"</p>
<p>"So you doubt the endurance of my philosophy?"</p>
<p>She shrugged; she extended her pretty hands expressively.</p>
<p>"Monsieur is young!"</p>
<p>The words exasperated Max. Again it had arisen&mdash;the old
argument. The anger smouldering in his heart since the girl's
invasion flamed to speech.</p>
<p>"I could wish that the world was less ready with that opinion,
mademoiselle! It knows very little of what it says."</p>
<p>"Possibly, monsieur! but you admit that&mdash;that you are
scarcely aged." There was a quiver now about the pretty lips, a
hint of a laugh in the eyes.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle,"&mdash;he wheeled round with unexpected
vehemence,&mdash;"I should like you, to tell me exactly how old you
think I am."</p>
<p>"You mean it, monsieur?"</p>
<p>"I mean it. Is it seventeen&mdash;or is it sixteen?" His voice
was edged with irony.</p>
<p>"It is neither, monsieur!" Jacqueline was very demure now, her
eyes sought the floor. "Granted your full permission, monsieur, I
would say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You would say&mdash;?"</p>
<p>"I would say"&mdash;she flashed a daring look at him and
instantly dropped her eyes again&mdash;"I would say that you have
twenty-four, if not twenty-five years!"</p>
<p>The confession came in a little rush of speech, and as it left
her lips she moved toward the door, contemplating flight.</p>
<p>An immense surprise clouded Max's mind, a surprise that brought
the blood mantling to his face and sent his words forth with a
stammering indecision.</p>
<p>"Twenty-four&mdash;twenty-five! What gave you that idea?"</p>
<p>"Oh, monsieur, it is simple! It came to me by observation!"</p>
<p>Leaving Max still red, still confused, she slipped out of the
room noiselessly as she had come, and as the door closed he heard
the faint, exasperating sound of a light little laugh.</p>
<hr style='width: 65%;'>
<br>
<br>
<a name='CHAPTER_XVI'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">AFTER Jacqueline had closed the door and the
light laugh had died into silence, Max stood before his easel,
hands inert, the flush still scorching his face. For the first time
since the birth of the new life he had been made sensible of
personal criticism&mdash;the criticism winged with fine ridicule,
that leaves its victim strangely uncertain, curiously uneasy. The
immemorial subtlety of woman had lurked in the girl's eyes as she
cast her last penetrating glance at him. He felt now, as he stood
alone, that his soul had been stripped and was naked to the bare
walls and gaping canvas, and his start was one of purely unbalanced
nerves when a knock fell upon the door, telling of a new
intruder.</div>
<p>He had all but cried out in protest when the door opened, but at
sight of the invader the cry merged into an unstrung laugh of
welcome.</p>
<p>"Ned! You?"</p>
<p>Blake walked into the room, talking as he came. "Well, upon my
word! Wasn't I right? Here he is, easel and canvas and
all&mdash;even the temper isn't wanting!"</p>
<p>Max ran forward, caught and clung to his arm.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon ami</i>! <i>Mon cher</i>! I have wanted you&mdash;wanted
you."</p>
<p>"Anything wrong?"</p>
<p>"No! No! Nothing. It was only&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Again Max laughed nervously, but his fingers tightened.</p>
<p>"Only this&mdash;I have wanted to hear you say that I am your
friend&mdash;your boy, Max&mdash;as I was yesterday and the day
before and the day before. Say it! Say it!" His eyes besought
Blake's.</p>
<p>"What! Tell you you are yourself?"</p>
<p>He nodded quickly and seriously.</p>
<p>The other looked into his face, and for some unaccountable
reason his amusement died away.</p>
<p>"What a child it is!" he said kindly; and, putting his hands
upon the boy's shoulders, he shook him gently. "Who has been
putting notions into your head? Whoever it is, just refer him to
me; I'll deal with him."</p>
<p>It was Max's turn to laugh. "Ah, but I am better now! I am quite
all right now! It was only for the moment!" He made a little sound,
half shy, half relieved. "It was, I suppose, as you expected; I
tired myself with carrying up these things, and then I still more
tired myself with trying to block in my picture, and
then&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, then?"</p>
<p>"No more&mdash;nothing."</p>
<p>"I'm sceptical of that."</p>
<p>Max glanced up. "Well, to you I always say the truth. The girl
Jacqueline came in and chattered to me, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, ho!"</p>
<p>"Do not say that! I cannot bear it."</p>
<p>"Nonsense! I'm only teasing you! Though why a little girl with
hair like spun silk and skin like ivory&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah! You admire her, then?"</p>
<p>"I do vastly&mdash;in the abstract."</p>
<p>"And what does that mean&mdash;in the abstract?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know! I suppose it means that if I were a painter I
might use her as a model, or if I were a poet I might string a
verse to her; but being an ordinary man, it means&mdash;well, it
means that I don't feel drawn to kiss her. Do you see?"</p>
<p>"I see." Max grew thoughtful; he disengaged the hands still
lying lightly on his shoulders and walked back to his easel.</p>
<p>"You don't a bit! But it doesn't matter! What is it you're
doing?"</p>
<p>Max, idle before his canvas, did not reply.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon ami?</i>" he said, irrelevantly.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Tell me the sort of woman you want to kiss."</p>
<p>Blake looked round in surprise.</p>
<p>"Well, to begin with, I used the word symbolically. I'm a queer
beggar, you know; the kiss means a good deal to me. To me, it's the
key to the idealistic as well as the materialistic&mdash;the toll
at the gateway. I never kiss the light woman."</p>
<p>"No?" Max's voice was very low, his hands hung by his sides, the
look in his half-veiled eyes was strange. "Then what is she
like&mdash;the woman you would kiss?"</p>
<p>"Oh, she has no bodily form. One does not say 'her hair shall be
black' or 'her hair shall be red' any more than one makes an image
of God. She dwells in the mysterious. Even when the time comes and
she steps into reality, mystery will still cling to her. There must
always be the wonder&mdash;the miracle." He spoke softly, as he
always spoke when sentiment entrapped him. His native turn of
thought found vent at these odd times and made him infinitely
interesting. The slight satire that was ordinarily wont to twist
his smile was smoothed away, and a certain sadness stole into its
place; his green eyes lost their keenness of observation and looked
into a space obscure to others. In these rare moments he was
essentially of his race and of his country.</p>
<p>"No," he added, as if to himself, "a man does not say 'her hair
shall be red' or 'her hair shall be black'!"</p>
<p>"It is very curious&mdash;very strange&mdash;a dream like that!"
Max's voice was a mere whisper.</p>
<p>"Without his dreams, man would be an animal."</p>
<p>"And you, then, wait for this woman? In seriousness you wait,
and believe that out of nothing she will come to you?"</p>
<p>Blake turned away and walked slowly to the window, the sadness,
the aloofness still visible in his face like the glow from a
shrouded light.</p>
<p>"That's the hardship of it, boy&mdash;the faith that it wants
and the patience that it wants! Sometimes it takes the heart out of
a man! There're days when I feel like a derelict; when I say to
myself, 'Here I am, thirty-eight years old, unanchored,
unharbored.' Oh, I know I'm young as the world counts age! I know
that plenty of men and women like me, and that I pass the time of
day to plenty as I go along! But all the same, if I died to-morrow
there isn't one would break a heart over me. Not a solitary
one."</p>
<p>"Do not say that!"</p>
<p>"It's true, all the same! Sometimes I say to myself, 'Wha a fool
you are, Ned Blake! The Almighty gives reality to some and dreams
to some, and who knows but your lot is to go down to your grave
hugging empty hopes, like your forefathers before you!' It's
terrible, sometimes, the way the heart goes out of a man!"</p>
<p>"Ned! Ned! Do not say that!" Max's voice was strangely troubled,
strangely unlike itself, so unlike and troubled that it wakened
Blake to self-consciousness.</p>
<p>"I'm talking rank nonsense! I'm a fool!"</p>
<p>"You are not!" The boy ran across to him impulsively; then
paused, mute and shy.</p>
<p>"What is it, boy?"</p>
<p>"Only that what you say is not the truth. If you were to die,
there is one person who would&mdash;"</p>
<p>Blake's face softened. He was surprised and touched.</p>
<p>"What? You'd care?"</p>
<p>Max nodded.</p>
<p>"Thank you, boy! Thank you for that!"</p>
<p>They stood silent for a moment, looking through the uncurtained
window at the February breezes ruffling the holly bushes in the
plantation, each unusually aware of the other's presence, each
unusually self-conscious.</p>
<p>"But if it comes to pass&mdash;your miracle&mdash;you will
forget me? You will no longer have need of me, is that not so?"</p>
<p>Max spoke softly, a disproportionate seriousness darkening his
eyes, causing his voice to quiver.</p>
<p>Blake turned to answer in the same vein, but something checked
him&mdash;some embarrassment, some inexplicable doubt of
himself.</p>
<p>"Boy," he said, sharply, "we're running into deep waters. Don't
you think we ought to steer for shore? I came to smoke, you know,
and watch you at your work."</p>
<p>The words acted as a charm. Max threw up his head and gave a
little laugh, a trifle high, a shade hysterical.</p>
<p>"But, of course! But, of course! I believe I, too, was falling
into a dream; and the dream comes after, the work first, is it not
so? The work first; the work always first. Place another log upon
the fire and begin to smoke, and I swear to you that before the day
is finished I will make you proud of me. I swear it to you!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">THERE is impetus, if not necessarily inspiration
in a goading thought, and Max returned to his interrupted task with
a zeal almost in excess of his protestations. He worked with
vigor&mdash;with an exuberant daring that seemed to suggest that
the creation of his picture was rather the creation of a mental
narcotic than the expression of an idea.</div>
<p>He had given rein to sentiment in the moment with Blake, and now
he was applying the curb, working incessantly&mdash;- never pausing
to speak&mdash;never casting a glance at the corner where his
companion was smoking and dreaming over the fire.</p>
<p>To the casual observer it might have seemed a scene of ideal
comradeship; yet in the minds of the comrades there lurked an
uneasiness, an uncertainty not lightly to be placed&mdash;not
easily to be clothed in words. A certain warmth was stirring in
Blake's heart, coupled with a certain wonder at his sudden
discovery of the depth of the boy's regard; while in the boy's own
soul a tumult of feelings ran riot.</p>
<p>Shame burned him that he should have confessed himself;
amazement seared him that the confession had been there to make. A
bewildering annoyance filled him&mdash;a first doubting of the ego
he was cherishing with so fine a care.</p>
<p>It is indeed a black moment when an egoist doubts himself; it is
as if the god within the temple became self-conscious; more, it is
as if the god rent down the veil before the shrine and showed
himself a thing of clay to his astonished worshippers.</p>
<p>The mind of Max was a complex study as he worked with his
new-found vehemence, expressing or crushing a thought with each
bold stroke. He prided himself upon his powers of self-analysis;
and, being possessed as well of honesty and of a measure of common
sense, the mental picture that confronted him was scarcely pleasant
seeing. Doubt of himself&mdash;of his own omnipotence&mdash;- had
assailed him; and, being young, being spoiled of the world, it
found expression in bitter resentment.</p>
<p>Having continued his onslaught upon the canvas until midday was
close at hand, he suddenly astonished the unoffending Blake by
flinging his charcoal from him to the furthest end of the room,
where it broke rudely against the spotless wall-paper.</p>
<p>"God bless my soul!" Blake turned, to see an angry figure
striding to the window, his hair ruffled, his hands thrust deep
into his trouser pockets.</p>
<p>"What in God's name is the matter with you?"</p>
<p>There was no answer and, being a wise man, he did not press the
point.</p>
<p>Presently, as he expected, the boyish figure wheeled round.</p>
<p>"I cannot work. It is all bad! All wrong!"</p>
<p>He rose slowly and began to walk toward the easel, but with a
cry the boy ran forward and intercepted him.</p>
<p>"No! No! No! It is bad, I tell you&mdash;you must not see. Look!
This is what I shall do. This!" He turned and, swift as lightning,
snapped up a knife, and before Blake could find a gesture or a
word, ripped his canvas from end to end.</p>
<p>"Upon my word! Well, upon my word! There's an extravagant young
devil! Why, in the name of God, would you destroy your canvas like
that?"</p>
<p>"Why? Because, my friend, I am I! I do not work again upon a
thing that I have marred!" His voice shook, trembling between
excited laughter and tears.</p>
<p>Blake looked at him. "Bless my soul, if he isn't crying! Come
here to me! You're a baby!"</p>
<p>But Max turned on him, so furious that the hot anger in his eyes
scorched the tears that hung there.</p>
<p>"A baby? This much a baby, that I love my work so truly that I
have set it upon an altar and made it my religion! And when I find,
as to-day, that it fails me I am damned&mdash;my soul is lost!"</p>
<p>"And why does it fail you&mdash;to-day?"</p>
<p>"I do not know!"</p>
<p>"Is that the truth?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is."</p>
<p>"Are you perfectly sure? Are you perfectly sure that 'tisn't
I&mdash;my presence here&mdash;?"</p>
<p>"You?" Max withered him with a scorn meant for himself as well.
"You rate yourself high, my friend, and you imagine my work a very
trivial thing!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense! Plenty of artists must have solitude."</p>
<p>"Plenty of fools! An artist is engrossed in his art so perfectly
that when he stands before his canvas no world exists but the world
of his imagination. Do you suppose me to be affected because you
sit somewhere in the background, smoking over the fire? Oh, no! I
trust I have more capacity to concentrate!"</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders to the ears; he raised his eyebrows in
the very elaboration of indifference.</p>
<p>Blake, hot as he in pride or anger, caught sudden fire.</p>
<p>"Upon my soul, you're damned complimentary! I think, if you have
no objection, I'll be wishing you good-day!" He picked up his hat,
and strode to the door.</p>
<a name="look"></a>
<center><img src="images/ill154.jpg" width="400" height="601" alt=
"&quot;LOOK! THIS IS WHAT I SHALL DO. THIS!&quot;"></center>
<h5>"LOOK! THIS IS WHAT I SHALL DO. THIS!"</h5>
<p>The action was so abrupt, the offence so real, that it sobered
Max. With a sudden collapse of pride, he wheeled round.</p>
<p>"Ned! Oh, Ned!"</p>
<p>But the banging of the outer door was his only answer; and he
drew back, his face fallen to a sudden blankness of expression, his
hand going out as if for support to the tattered canvas.</p>
<p>Minutes passed&mdash;how many or how few he made no attempt to
reckon&mdash;then a tap fell on the door and his blood leaped,
leaped and dropped back to a sick pulsation of disappointment, as
the door opened and Jacqueline's fair head appeared.</p>
<p>For an instant a fierce resentment at this new intrusion fired
him, then the absorbing need for human sympathy welled up, drowning
all else.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle," he cried out, "I am the most unhappy person in
all the world; I have tried to make a picture and failed, and I
have quarrelled with my best friend!"</p>
<p>Jacqueline nodded sagely. "That, M. Max, is my excuse for
intruding. Of the picture, of course, I know nothing"&mdash;she
shrugged expressively&mdash;"but of the quarrel I understand
all&mdash;having passed M. Blake upon the stairs!"</p>
<p>At any other moment Max would have resented in swift and
explicit terms this probing of his private concerns; but the
soreness at his heart was too acute to permit of pride.</p>
<p>"Then you are sorry for me, mademoiselle?"</p>
<p>"Yes, monsieur!"</p>
<p>"Because of my spoiled picture?" Waywardness flickered up
momentarily.</p>
<p>"No, monsieur!"</p>
<p>"Then why?"</p>
<p>Jacqueline glanced up swiftly, then dropped her eyes.</p>
<p>"Because, monsieur&mdash;being but a woman&mdash;I say to myself
'life is long, and other pictures may be painted; but with
love&mdash;or friendship&mdash;'"</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle, that is sufficient! You are charming&mdash;you
are sympathetic&mdash;- but, like many others, you place too great
a value upon those words 'love' and 'friendship.' It is like this!
If I quarrel with my friend it is doubtless sad, but it only
affects myself; if, on the contrary, I paint a bad picture I am
making a blot upon a beautiful world!"</p>
<p>"And what of the heart, monsieur? May there not be sad stains
upon the heart&mdash;even if no eyes see them?"</p>
<p>"Now, mademoiselle, you are talking sentiment!"</p>
<p>"And you, monsieur, are materialistic?" For a second a flash of
mischief showed in the blue eyes.</p>
<p>Max stiffened his shoulders; made brave show to hide the
detestable ache in his soul.</p>
<p>"Yes, mademoiselle," he said. "I think, without pride, I may
claim to see life wholly, without idealization."</p>
<p>Quite unexpectedly Jacqueline clapped her hands and laughed,
stepping close to him with an engaging air of mystery.</p>
<p>"Then all is well! I have a physic for all your ills!"</p>
<p>He looked distrustful.</p>
<p>"A physic?"</p>
<p>"This, monsieur&mdash;that you put aside the great sorrow of
your picture, and the little sorrow of your friend&mdash;and step
across and partake of <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> with Lucien and me. A
very special <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, I assure you; no less than a
<i>poulet bonne femme</i>, cooked with a care&mdash;"</p>
<p>She threw out her hands in an ecstasy of expression, a portrayal
of the artless greed that had more than once brought a smile to the
boy's lips. But this time no amusement was called up; disgust rose
strong within him and, accompanying it, a certainty that were
Jacqueline's chicken to be laid before him, he must assuredly choke
with the first morsel. One does not eat when one has failed in
one's art&mdash;or quarrelled with one's best friend!</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle," he said, unsteadily, "you are kind&mdash;and I
am not without appreciation. But to-day I have no
appetite&mdash;food does not call to me. Doubtless, there are days
when M. Cartel cannot eat." He strove to force a laugh.</p>
<p>Jacqueline looked humorously grave.</p>
<p>"When Lucien cannot work, monsieur, he eats the more! It is only
on the days when work flows from him that I am compelled to drag
him to the table&mdash;those days or, perhaps, the days&mdash;" She
stopped discreetly.</p>
<p>"What days, mademoiselle?"</p>
<p>For the gratification of a curiosity he condemned, Max put the
question.</p>
<p>"Oh, monsieur, when some little affair arises upon which he and
I dispute&mdash;when some cloud, as it were, darkens the sun." She
continued to look down demurely; then quickly she looked up again.
"But I waste your time! And, besides, I have not finished what I
would say."</p>
<p>"Oh, mademoiselle, I beg&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It is not of the <i>poulet</i> that I would speak, monsieur! I
understand that artists are not all alike; and that, whereas bad
work gives Lucien an appetite, it gives you a disgust! Still, you
are a philosopher, and will allow others to eat, even if you will
not eat yourself."</p>
<p>Max looked bewildered.</p>
<p>"Good!" Jacqueline clapped her hands again softly. "I knew I
would find success! I said I would find success!"</p>
<p>"But, mademoiselle, I do not understand."</p>
<p>"No, monsieur! Neither did M. Blake, when I met him upon the
stairs, and told him of my <i>poulet</i>. He also, it seems, had
lost his appetite. Your picture must have been truly bad!"</p>
<p>She discreetly toyed with her belt during the accepted space of
time in which a brain can conceive&mdash;a heart leap&mdash;to an
overmastering joy; then she looked again at Max.</p>
<p>"It is a little idea of my own, monsieur, that you and M.
&Eacute;douard should make the acquaintance of my Lucien. M.
&Eacute;douard already consents; I hope that you,
monsieur&mdash;"</p>
<p>For answer, Max caught her hand. From that moment he loved
her&mdash;her prettiness, her mischief, her humanity.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle! I do not understand&mdash;and I do
understand!"</p>
<p>"But you will come, monsieur?"</p>
<p>"I will eat your chicken, mademoiselle&mdash;even to the
bones!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">COMRADESHIP in its broader sense is Bohemianism
at its best; Bohemianism, not as it is imagined by the
<i>dilettante</i>&mdash;a thing of picturesque penury and exotic
vice&mdash;but a spontaneous intermingling of personalities, an
understanding, a fraternity as purely a gift of the gods as love or
beauty.</div>
<p>It is true that the sense of regained happiness beat strong in
the mind of Max when he followed Jacqueline into her unpicturesque
living-room with its sparse, cheap furniture, its piano and its gas
stove, and that the happiness budded and blossomed like a flower in
the sun at the one swift glance exchanged with Blake; but even had
these factors not been present, he must still have been sensible of
the pretty touch of hospitality patent in the girl's manner the
moment she crossed her own threshold, conscious of the friendly
smile of M. Lucien Cartel, typical artist, typical Frenchman of the
southern provinces&mdash;short, swarthy, alive from his coarse
black hair to the square tips of his fingers. It was in the
air&mdash;the sense of good-will&mdash;the desire for conviviality;
and in the first greeting, the first hand-shake, the relations of
the party were established.</p>
<p>But the true note of this Bohemianism is not so much spontaneous
friendship as a spontaneous capacity for the interchange of
thought&mdash;that instant opening of mind to mind, when place
becomes of slight, and time of no importance.</p>
<p>Such an atmosphere was created by M. Lucien Cartel in his poor
Montmartre <i>appartement</i>, and under its spell Max and Blake
fell as surely, as luxuriously as they might have fallen under the
spell of a summer day. It was not that M. Cartel was brilliant; his
only capacity for brilliance lay in his strong, square hands; but
he was a good fellow and possessed of a philosophy that at once
challenged and interested. For Church and State he had a wide
contempt, a scoffing raillery, a candid blasphemy that outraged
orthodoxy: for humanity and for his art he owned an enthusiasm
touching on the sublime. Upon every subject&mdash;the meanest and
the most profound&mdash;he held an opinion and aired it with superb
frankness and incredible fluency. So it was that, when the
<i>poulet bonne femme</i> had been picked to the bones and
Jacqueline had retired to some sanctum whence the clatter of plates
and the sound of running water told of domestic duties, the three
pushed their chairs back from the table and fell to talk.</p>
<p>Precisely how they talked, precisely what they talked of in that
pleasant period subsequent to the meal is not to be related. They
thrashed the paths of morality, science, religion until their
contending voices filled the room and the tobacco smoke hung in
clouds about them. They talked until the last drop of Jacqueline's
coffee had been drained; they talked until Jacqueline herself came
silently back into the room and seated herself by Cartel's side,
slipping her hand into his with artless spontaneity.</p>
<p>Morality, science, religion, and then, in natural sequence,
art&mdash;music! The brain of M. Cartel tingled, his fingers
twitched as the rival merits of composers&mdash;the varying schools
of thought&mdash;were touched upon, warmed to, or torn by
contending opinions. One end only was conceivable to that last
discussion. The moment arrived when the brain of M. Cartel cried
vehemently for expression, when his hand, imprisoned in the small
fingers of Jacqueline, was no longer to be restrained, when he
sprang from his chair and rushed to the piano, his coarse black
hair an untidy mat, his ugly face alight with God's gift of
inspiration.</p>
<p>'What had he said? Was this, then, not
magnificent&mdash;wonderful?'</p>
<p>And, seating himself, he unloosed into the common room a beauty
of sound more adorning than the rarest devices of the decorator's
art&mdash;a mesh of delicate harmonies that snared the imaginations
of his three listeners and sent them winging to the very borders of
their varying realms.</p>
<p>M. Lucien Cartel in every-day life and to the casual observer
was a good fellow with a fund of enthusiasm and a ready tongue; M.
Lucien Cartel to the woman he loved and in the enchanted world of
his art was a mortal imbued warmly and surely with a spark of the
divinity he derided. There is no niggardliness in Bohemia: it made
him as happy to give of his music as it made his listeners to
receive, with the consequence that time was dethroned and that four
people sat entranced, claiming nothing from the world outside, more
than content in the knowledge that the world had no eyes for the
doings of a little room on the heights of Montmartre.</p>
<p>From opera to opera M. Cartel wandered, now humming a passage
under his breath in accompaniment to his playing, again raising his
soft, southern voice in an abandonment of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>It was following close upon some such enthusiastic moment that
Max rose, crossed the room, and taking a violin and bow from where
they lay upon a wooden bench against the wall, carried them
silently to the piano.</p>
<p>As silently M. Cartel received them and, lifting the violin,
tucked it under his chin and raised the bow.</p>
<p>There is no need to detail the magic that followed upon that
simple action. The world&mdash;even his own Paris&mdash;has never
heard of M. Lucien Cartel, and cares not to know of the pieces that
he played, the degree of his technique, the truth of his
interpretation; but when at last the hand that held the violin
dropped to his side and, lifting his right arm, he wiped his damp
forehead with the sleeve of his coat, the faces of his audience
were pale as the faces of those who have looked upon hidden places,
and in the eyes of the little Jacqueline there were tears.</p>
<p>A moment of silence; then M. Cartel laid down his violin and
laughed. The laugh broke the spell: Jacqueline, with a childish cry
of excitement, flew across the room and, throwing her arms about
his neck, kissed him with unashamed fervor; Blake and Max pressed
round the piano, and in an instant the room was humming again to
the sound of voices, and some one made the astounding discovery
that it was five o'clock.</p>
<p>This was Blake's opportunity&mdash;the opportunity loved beyond
all others of the Irishman, when it is permissible to offer
hospitality. The idea came to him as an inspiration, and was seized
upon as such. Eager as a boy, he laid one hand on Max's shoulder,
the other on that of M. Cartel.</p>
<p>'He had a suggestion to make! One that admitted of no refusal!
M. Cartel had entertained them regally; he must suffer them to make
some poor return. There was a certain little <i>caf&eacute;</i>
where the <i>chef</i> knew his business and the wine really was
wine&mdash;' He looked from one face to another for approval, and
perhaps it was but natural that his eyes should rest last and
longest on the face of Max.</p>
<p>So it was arranged. A dinner is a question readily dealt with in
the quarter of Montmartre, and soon the four&mdash;laughing,
talking, arguing&mdash;were hurrying down the many steps of the
Escalier de Sainte-Marie, bent upon the enjoyment of the hour.</p>
<hr style='width: 65%;'>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">THEY dined with a full measure of satisfaction;
for with his invitation to a feast, your Parisian accepts an
obligation to bring forth his best in gayety, in conversation, in
good-will; and it might well have happened that Blake, spending ten
times as much money upon guests of his own world, might have lacked
the glow, the sense of success, that filled him in the giving of
this dinner to an unknown musician and a little blonde-haired
<i>Montmartroise</i>.</div>
<p>They dined; and then, because the winds were still wintry and
coffee could not yet be sipped outside <i>caf&eacute;</i> doors,
they betook themselves to the little theatre of the 'Trianon
Lyrique' on the Boulevard Rochechouart, where for an infinitesimal
sum the <i>bourgeoisie</i> may sit in the stalls and hear light
opera conscientiously sung.</p>
<p>As it was a gala evening, Blake reserved a box, and the little
Jacqueline sat in the place of honor, neat and dainty to the point
of perfection, with a small black jacket fitting closely to her
figure, and a bunch of violets, costing ten centimes, pinned
coquettishly into her lace <i>jabot</i>. They sat through the
performance in a happy mood of toleration, applauding whenever
applause might be bestowed, generously silent when anything tempted
adverse criticism; and between the acts they smoked and drank
liqueurs in company with the good Montmartre shopkeepers&mdash;the
soldiers&mdash;the young clerks and the young girls who formed the
crowd in the lounge.</p>
<p>But all things end; the curtain fell on the last act of <i>Les
Cloches de Corneville</i>, and not without a pleasant, passing
sigh, the four left the theatre.</p>
<p>The boulevard teemed with life as they made their way into the
open; a certain intoxication seemed blown along the thoroughfare on
the light spring wind; a restless energy tingled in the blood.</p>
<p>On the steps of the little theatre, Blake looked back at his
party.</p>
<p>'The night was young! What would they say to supper?'</p>
<p>Jacqueline's eyes sparkled, but she looked at M. Cartel, and
regretfully M. Cartel shook his head.</p>
<p>'Alas! He was expecting a friend&mdash;a composer, to call upon
him before midnight.'</p>
<p>Jacqueline betrayed no disappointment; with a charming air she
echoed the regret, the shake of the head, and slipped a confiding
hand through M. Cartel's arm.</p>
<p>Then followed the leave-taking&mdash;the thanks and
disclaimers&mdash;the promises of future meetings&mdash;and at last
the lovers moved out into the crowd&mdash;M. Cartel, cheery and
brisk, humming the tunes of '<i>Les Cloches</i>,' the little
Jacqueline clinging to his arm, smiling up into his ugly face.</p>
<p>Max watched them for a moment with a deep intentness, then
wheeled round swiftly and caught Blake's arm.</p>
<p>"Ned! Take me somewhere! I would forget myself!"</p>
<p>"What troubles you, boy? Not the thought of the picture?"</p>
<p>"No! A something of no consequence. Do not question me. Be kind
to me, and take me where I can see life and forget myself."</p>
<p>"Where will I take you?"</p>
<p>"To some place of gayety&mdash;where no one thinks."</p>
<p>"Very well! We'll go over and have supper at the Rat Mort. You
won't be over-troubled with thought there. We can sit in a corner
and observe, and I give you my word there will be no encounters
with old friends this time! I'll be blind and deaf and dumb if
anything is washed up from the past!"</p>
<p>Guiding the boy across the crowded roadway, he passed through
the narrow door and up the steep stair that ends so abruptly into
the long, low supper-room of the Rat Mort.</p>
<p>Max felt the abruptness of this entry, as so many climbers of
the ladder-like stairs have felt it before him; and a dazed
sensation seized upon him as the wild <i>Ztigane</i> music of the
stringed orchestra beat suddenly upon his ears and the intense
white light struck upon his sight.</p>
<p>He felt it as others have felt it&mdash;the excitement, the
consciousness of an emotional atmosphere&mdash;as he followed Blake
down the dazzingly bright room. It was in the air, as it had been
at the Bal Tabarin.</p>
<p>As they seated themselves, the barbaric music ceased; the
orchestra broke forth afresh with a light Parisian waltz, and down
between the lines of tables came a negro and a
negress&mdash;properties of the place, as were the glasses and the
table linen&mdash;waltzing with the pliant suppleness, the
conscious sensuality of their race, and close behind them followed
a second couple&mdash;a Spaniard, restless and lithe, small of
stature and pallid of face, and a young Spanish girl of splendid
physique.</p>
<p>Max sat silent, attentive to this dance, while Blake ordered
supper; but when the wine was brought, he lifted his glass and
drank, as if some strong sensation had dried his throat.</p>
<p>Blake turned and looked at him.</p>
<p>"Well? Is it amusing?"</p>
<p>"It is&mdash;and it is not. Those black creatures are
extraordinary. They are repulsive&mdash;like figures in a
nightmare."</p>
<p>"Oh! Repulsive, are they? And what about a certain picture we
once looked at&mdash;when I was swept off the face of the earth for
using that same word? I believe, you know, that points of view are
changing! I believe I'm coming to part two of my little book! These
niggers aren't a bit more disgusting than the monkey sucking the
fruit."</p>
<p>Max glanced at him, laughed a trifle self-consciously and drank
some more wine. "Let us forget monkeys and little books and all
such stupidities. There is a pretty woman over there! Make me a
story concerning her." He nodded toward a table in the middle of
the room.</p>
<p>Blake, looking, saw a slim woman in white, whose large hat threw
a becoming shadow on auburn hair and red-brown eyes.</p>
<p>"Ah, now," he said, thoughtfully, "you've given me too much to
do! At a first glance I'd say she's just the ordinary better-class
<i>cocotte</i>; but at a second glance it seems to me I'd pause.
There's something about the eyes&mdash;there's something about the
mouth that puzzles me. You'll have to wait, my boy, and let fate
tell you your fairy tale!"</p>
<p>Trained in the consciousness of regard, the woman they discussed
looked across at them as Blake ceased, and the flicker of a smile
touched her lips&mdash;a smile of interest in which there lurked no
hint of invitation.</p>
<p>"Ah, wasn't I right! She discriminates&mdash;our auburn lady!
We'll see something interesting before the night is out, mark my
words!"</p>
<p>They half forgot her and her possible story in the hour that
followed, though Max noted that the woman who wanders from party to
party at the Rat Mort, distributing roses, paused twice by her
table and spoke to her, each time departing without unburdening
herself of her wares; also, he noted that the pallid little
Spaniard, who had been scattering his attentions among the ladies
unprovided with companions, came and bowed before her, and that,
contrary to her impression of aloofness, she rose and danced a
waltz with him.</p>
<p>At this episode of the dance, Blake's eyes as well as the boy's
were attracted; and, as she glided up and down between the tables,
cool, unmoved, seemingly indifferent to the world about her, his
interest reawakened, and he cast a sidelong glance at Max.</p>
<p>"Wait!" he said. "When you see that guarded look in a woman's
eyes, you may always know she's expecting something."</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, she returned to her solitary table, dismissing
the Spaniard with an inclination of the head and, as she seated
herself, both observers saw a change pass over her face&mdash;saw
her gaze narrow and turn toward the door&mdash;saw a faint flush
touch her cheeks and recede, leaving them paler than before.</p>
<p>It was a controlled emotion, almost
imperceptible&mdash;differing in essence from either the latent
violence of the woman Lize or the artless impulsiveness of the
little Jacqueline; but with certain intuition it sent Max's glance
winging to the door of the supper-room, assured that some issue in
the subtle war of sex was about to be fought out.</p>
<p>A new party was entering the room&mdash;a small dark
<i>Parisienne</i>, bringing in her wake two Englishmen&mdash;one
brown&mdash;the other fair, with the accepted Saxon fairness.</p>
<p>Down the long room the little lady came, ushered by obsequious
waiters, the recipient of many glances, admiring or envious; close
behind her followed the brown-haired Englishman and, a little in
the rear, her second cavalier&mdash;reserved of demeanor,
distinguished of carriage, obviously upholding the tradition of
<i>sang-froid</i> that clings to his countrymen.</p>
<p>Max's instinct was fully awake now; and when, in passing her
table, the fair man inclined his head to the auburn-haired lady,
the matter merely fitted with his expectations.</p>
<p>What brief emotional past lay in the mists of the unknown,
linking this woman to this man? Nothing was to be read from her
face&mdash;no expression of pleasure, none of chagrin; but in her
half-veiled eyes a certain brilliance was observable and her long,
white fingers began softly to drum upon the table in time to the
music.</p>
<p>No explanation was demanded; in a clear, disconcerting flash,
the situation was laid bare. Here was woman desiring the love of
man; woman determined to reap her spoil. It was one issue in the
deathless, relentless struggle&mdash;the struggle wherein the
little Jacqueline clung to her M. Cartel, tenacious as the frail
fern to the ungainly rock&mdash;wherein Madame Salas had fought
sickness and neglect to protect a fading life. It was a
truth&mdash;arresting as truth must ever be; and stricken with a
tingling fear, the boy drove it from him, and turned his eyes from
the fateful, shadowed face and the light, drumming fingers.</p>
<p>A new dance had begun: the grinning negro had seized upon the
Spanish girl and was whirling her down the room to the laughter of
the company, while her countryman looked round the tables in
indifferent search for a partner.</p>
<p>His glance skimmed the white figure at the lonely table, the
eyes of the woman were lifted for an instant, revealing a flash of
their new light, and in a moment the two were dancing again, moving
up and down the room, in and out between the tables with their
original easy grace; but this time the woman's lips were parted and
her eyelids drooped in a clever simulation of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Up and down they glided, passing and repassing the table where
the little dark lady supped with her two cavaliers, but never once
did the woman raise her eyes to the Englishman's or seem aware of
the cold, close glance that followed her movements; but once, as
the music faded to silence, and her white skirt swept past his
table for the last time, she murmured something softly in Spanish
to her partner, and allowed one level, effective glance to fall on
his pallid face.</p>
<p>That was all; the waltz stopped, she disengaged herself gently,
and walked back alone to her table.</p>
<p>This waltz was followed by another and yet another, and again
she fell to her old attitude of lowered eyes and drumming
fingers.</p>
<p>The Englishman at his table made pretence to eat his supper,
poured himself out a fresh glass of champagne, drank it, and with a
suddenly achieved decision, gave a cool laugh of excuse, rose and
walked straight toward the solitary figure.</p>
<p>Max, momentarily <i>clairvoyant</i>, felt the violent heartbeat,
the caught breath, that told the woman of his presence&mdash;felt
to a nicety the control of her expression, the rigidity of her
body, as she slowly raised her head and met his eyes; then he saw
the man bow, making some suggestion, and he leaned back in his seat
with a little sigh of satisfaction as the woman smiled and rose and
the two began to dance.</p>
<p>Both tall above the ordinary, they were a well-suited couple,
and a certain pleasure filled the beholder's mind as they moved
decorously up and down the long aisle formed by the double row of
tables&mdash;the man entirely indifferent to his surroundings,
dancing in this Parisian supper-place precisely as he would have
danced in a London ball-room; the woman following his every
movement with a passivity&mdash;a oneness&mdash;that gave no hint
of the definite purpose at work within her brain.</p>
<p>The dance over, he led her back to her table, drew her chair
forward with elaborate politeness, bowed and, with a murmured word,
strolled back to his own table.</p>
<p>So sure had been her triumph, so abrupt its collapse, that
Max&mdash;smoking his cigarette, sipping his coffee&mdash;turned,
with a little exclamation, to Blake.</p>
<p>"Have you observed, <i>mon ami</i>? Oh, why was that?"</p>
<p>Blake was carefully lighting a cigar.</p>
<p>"'Twould be hard to say," he answered, meditatively. "In a
matter of emotion, an Englishman has a way of getting frightened of
himself. This particular specimen has come over to Paris to
play&mdash;and he doesn't fancy fire for a toy!"</p>
<p>"And what will happen? What will be the end?" Max had laid his
cigarette aside; his fingers were interlaced, sure sign that his
emotions were running high; and his eyes, when he fixed them on
Blake's, held a touch of their rare sombre fire.</p>
<p>"How will it end, you say? Guess, my child!"</p>
<p>Max shook his head.</p>
<p>"Well, boy, Eve will be Eve to the end of time&mdash;and Adam
will be Adam!"</p>
<p>"You mean&mdash;? Oh, but look!"</p>
<p>This last was called forth by the rising from table of the
trio&mdash;the quiet passing from the room of the fair man in the
train of his friend and the little dark lady.</p>
<p>It seemed so final, so sharp an answer to his question, that Max
could feel&mdash;as things personal and close&mdash;the sick
sinking of the heart, the accompanying whiteness of cheek that must
fall upon the woman sitting immovable and alone.</p>
<p>"I am sorry!" he cried. "Oh, but I am sorry!"</p>
<p>Blake looked thoughtfully at the tip of his cigar.</p>
<p>"Wait!"</p>
<p>Even as he said it, the fair man reappeared alone. "What did I
say? Eve will be Eve&mdash;Adam will be Adam!"</p>
<p>But Max was not listening. Excited, lifted beyond himself, he
was watching the Englishman thread a way between the
tables&mdash;watching the woman thrill to his approach without
lifting an eyelid, moving a muscle. Rigid as a statue she sat,
until he was quite close; then, curiously, as if nature demanded
some symbol of the fires within, her lips opened and she began to
hum the tune the orchestra was playing.</p>
<p>It was a strange form of self-expression, and as she yielded to
it her cheeks burned suddenly and her eyes shone between their
narrowed lids.</p>
<p>She did not speak when the man seated himself at her table, she
did not even look up; she went on humming in a strange ecstatic
reverie, but she smiled&mdash;a very slow, a very subtle smile.</p>
<p>A waiter came, and wine was brought; she drank, laid down her
glass and continued her strange song. The seller of flowers hovered
about the table, smiling at the Englishman, and laid a sheaf of
pink roses on the white cloth; still the humming continued, though
mechanically the woman's long, white fingers gathered up the
flowers and held them against her face. At last, unexpectedly, she
raised her head, looked at the man whose eyes were now fixed in
fascination upon her, looked away beyond him, and, lifting her
voice from its murmuring note, began to sing aloud.</p>
<p>It was a scene curious beyond description&mdash;the hot, white
room, the many painted faces, the many jewelled hands, the
grotesque black forms of the negro dancers, and in the midst a
woman hypnotized by her own triumph into absolute oblivion.</p>
<p>She sat with the roses in her hands, her eyes looking into
space, while her voice, pure and singularly true, gathered strength
until gradually the chattering of voices and the clinking of
glasses lessened, and the musicians lowered their music to a
deliberate accompaniment.</p>
<p>Nowhere but in Paris could such a scene take place; but here,
although the faces turned toward the singer's were flushed with
wine, they were touched with comprehension. The gathered
roses&mdash;the high, sweet voice&mdash;the rapt face composed a
picture, and even when his eyes are glazed, your Parisian is a
connoisseur.</p>
<p>The last note quivered into silence; a little ripple of applause
followed; and with the same concentrated, hypnotized gaze, the
woman's eyes turned from space and rested again upon the man.</p>
<p>It was the glance ancient as tradition&mdash;significant as
fate. At his distant table, Max rose and laid a trembling hand upon
Blake's arm.</p>
<p>"Ned! May we go?"</p>
<p>"Oh, why? The night is young!"</p>
<p>"Please!"</p>
<p>"But why?"</p>
<p>"I desire it."</p>
<p>Blake looked more closely, and his expression changed.</p>
<p>"Why, you're ill, boy!" he said. "You're as white as a
sheet!"</p>
<p>Max tried to laugh. "It is the heat&mdash;nothing more."</p>
<p>"Of course it is! The place is like a hot-house! You want a
breath of air!"</p>
<p>Again Max tried to laugh, but it was a laugh oddly broken.</p>
<p>"That is it!" he said. "I want the air."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">MAX passed down the long, low room, blind to the
white light, blind to the flowers and faces, deaf to the voices and
laughter and swaying sound of stringed instruments.</div>
<p>One glance he permitted himself&mdash;one only&mdash;at the
table where the man and woman still looked into each other's eyes
and where the sheaf of pink roses still shed its incense: then he
passed down the steep, short stairs, halting at the door of the
<i>caf&eacute;</i>, hesitating between two
atmospheres&mdash;outside, the sharp street lights, the cold,
wind-swept pavement&mdash;within, the hot air, the close sense of
humanity, powerful as a narcotic.</p>
<p>"Ned!" he said, looking back for Blake, "I need a favor. Will
you grant it?"</p>
<p>"A hundred!" Blake was buttoning up his coat.</p>
<p>"Then wish me good-night here. I would go home alone."</p>
<p>"Alone? What nonsense! You don't think I'd desert you when
you're seedy? What you want is air. We'll take a stroll along the
boulevards."</p>
<p>Max shook his head. He seemed rapt in his own thoughts; his pale
face was full of purpose.</p>
<p>"I am quite well&mdash;now."</p>
<p>"Then all the more reason for the stroll! Come along!"</p>
<p>But the boy drew away. "Another time! Not to-night."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"I cannot tell you."</p>
<p>Blake looked more closely at the nervously set lips, the dark
eyebrows drawn into a frown.</p>
<p>"I say, boy, it hasn't got on your nerves&mdash;this place? I
know what a queer little beggar you are."</p>
<p>"No; it is not that."</p>
<p>"Then what? Another inspiration?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Very well! I won't probe. I'm old enough to know that the human
animal is inexplicable. Good-night&mdash;and good luck! I'll see
you to-morrow."</p>
<p>"To-morrow, yes!"</p>
<p>There was relief in the readiness of the response, relief in the
quick thrusting forth of the boy's hand.</p>
<p>"Good-night!"</p>
<p>"Good-night! And go to bed when you get home. You're very
white."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>His voice seemed to recede further into its distant absorbed
note, his fingers were withdrawn from Blake's close pressure with a
haste that was unusual, and turning away, he crossed the boulevard
as though the vision of some spectre had lent wings to his
feet.</p>
<p>No impression of romance touched him as he hastened up the
narrow streets toward his home. He had no eyes for the secret
shadows, the mysterious corners usually so fruitful of suggestion;
his whole perceptions were turned inward; his self-consciousness
was a thing so living, so acute that he went forward as one bereft
of sight or hearing.</p>
<p>Reaching the foot of the Escalier de Sainte-Marie, he quickened
his already hurried pace, and began to run up the uneven steps. The
door of his house stood open, and he plunged into the dark well of
the hall without waiting to strike a match. By instinct his hand
found the smooth banister, and he began his climb of the
stairs.</p>
<p>Up he went, and up, living in himself with that perfect
absorption that comes in rare and violent moments&mdash;moments of
sorrow, of pleasure or, it may be, of surprise, when a new thought
suspends the action of the brain.</p>
<p>In obedience to some unconsidered instinct he softened his steps
on reaching the fifth floor, and crept across the bare corridor to
the door of his own rooms.</p>
<p>He entered quietly, and still ignoring the need for light,
groped a way to his bedroom.</p>
<p>It was the room that had once belonged to Madame Salas; and,
like the kitchen, it looked upon the network of roofs and chimneys
that spread away at the rear of the house. Now, as he entered,
closed the door, and stood leaning against it, breathing quickly,
these roofs and chimneys, seen through the uncurtained window, made
a picturesque medley of lines and curves startlingly distinct
against the star-powdered sky.</p>
<p>The ethereal light of a Parisian spring night filled the room,
touching the white walls&mdash;the white bed&mdash;a bowl of
flowers upon the dressing-table and its fairy-like reflection in
the mirror&mdash;to a subtly insidious fragility that verged upon
the unreal; and the boy, quivering to his tangled sensations, felt
this unreality quicken his self-distrust, touch and goad him as a
spur.</p>
<p>Physical action became imperative; he walked unsteadily across
the room, pulled the serge curtains across the window, abruptly
shutting out both stars and roofs, and turning to the
dressing-table, groped for matches and struck a light.</p>
<p>Four candles stood in an old silver candelabra; he touched them
with the match-flame, they flickered, spat, rose to a steady glow.
In the new light the room looked warmer, more in touch with human
things and, moving with the inevitableness of a pendulum, his mind
swung to a definite desire.</p>
<p>Impulse seized him; questions, doubts, fears were submerged;
trembling to a loosed emotion, he ran across the room and bent over
his narrow bed.</p>
<p>He was alone now; alone in the absolutely primal sense of the
word, when the individual ceases to act even to himself. The
instinct he had denied was dominating him, and he was yielding with
a sense of intoxication.</p>
<p>With hands that shook in excitement, he raised the mattress and,
searching beneath, drew forth an object&mdash;a flat packet, bound
and sealed&mdash;the packet, in fine, that had lain so deep and
snug in the pocket of his overcoat on the night of his entry into
Paris.</p>
<p>His hand&mdash;his whole body&mdash;was trembling as he brought
it to light and walked back to the dressing-table.</p>
<p>There, he pulled forward a chair and sat down before the mirror.
For a full minute he sat, as if enchained, then at length&mdash;in
obedience to the force that was dominating him&mdash;his fingers
crept under the string, there came to the ear a faint, sharp
crackle, and the seals broke.</p>
<p>The seals broke, a gasp slipped from between his parted lips,
and in his hands lay the symbol of all the imaginings, all the
pretty mockery wherewith he purported to cheat nature.</p>
<p>It lay in his hands&mdash;a simple thing, potent as simple
things ever are. No rare jewel, no state paper, merely the long,
thick strands of a woman's hair.</p>
<p>The paper fell away, and he lifted it shakingly to the light.
Stiff-coiled from its long imprisonment, it unwound slowly,
allowing the candle-light to filch strange hues from its dark
length&mdash;glints of bronze, tinges of copper-color that gleamed
elusively from the one end, where it had been roughly clipped from
the head, to the other, where it still curled and twisted into
little tendrils like a living thing.</p>
<p>A woman's hair! A weapon old as time&mdash;as light, as
destructible, as possessed of subtle powers as woman herself.
Strand upon strand, he drew it out, following the glints of light
with dazed, questioning eyes.</p>
<p>A woman's hair! A woman's hair, woven to blind men's eyes!</p>
<p>Max leaned forward, quivering to a new impulse, and, raising the
heavy coils, twisted them swiftly about his head. With the action,
the blood rushed into his cheeks, a flame of excitement sprang into
his eyes and, drawing the candles closer, he peered into the
mirror.</p>
<p>There are moments when a retrospective impression is
overwhelming&mdash;when a scent, a sight, a sound can quicken
things dead&mdash;things buried out of mind.</p>
<p>Max looked and, looking, lost himself. The boy with his bravery
of ignorance, his frankly arrogant egoism was effaced as might be
the writing from a slate, and in his place was a sexless creature,
rarely beautiful, with parted, tremulous lips and wide eyes in
which subtle, crowding thoughts struggled for expression.</p>
<p>He looked, he lost himself, and losing, heard nothing of a
sound, faint and undefined, that stole from the region of the outer
door&mdash;nothing of a light step in the little hall outside his
room. Leaning closer to the mirror, still gazing absorbed, he began
to twist the short waves of his own hair more closely into the
strands that resembled them so nearly in texture and hue.</p>
<p>It was then, quietly&mdash;with the appalling quietude that can
appertain to a fateful action&mdash;that the handle of the bedroom
door clicked, the door itself opened, and the little
Jacqueline&mdash;more child than ever in the throes of a swift
amazement&mdash;stood revealed, a lighted candle in one hand, in
the other a china mug.</p>
<p>At sound of the entry, Max had wheeled round, his hands still
automatically holding up the strands of hair; at the vision that
confronted him, a look of rage flashed over his face&mdash;the
violent, unrestrained rage of the creature taken unawares.</p>
<p>At the look the little Jacqueline quailed, her lips opened and
drooped, her right hand was lowered, until the candlestick hung at
a perilous angle and the wax began to drip upon the floor.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she cried, "and I thought to find the room empty!
<i>Pardon! Pardon!</i> Oh, <i>pardon, mons&mdash;madame!</i>"</p>
<hr style='width: 65%;'>
<br>
<br>
<a name='CHAPTER_XXI'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">IT was spoken&mdash;the one word, so brief, so
significant; and Jacqueline stood hesitating, pleading, equally
ready to rush forward or to fly.</div>
<p>At last Max spoke.</p>
<p>"Why do you call me that?"</p>
<p>The tone in which the question was put was extremely low, the
gray eyes were steady almost to coldness, the strong, slight
fingers began mechanically to fold up the hair, strand upon
strand.</p>
<p>Jacqueline's candle swayed, until a stream of the melted wax
guttered to the floor.</p>
<p>"Because&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Because&mdash;oh, because&mdash;because&mdash;I have always
known!"</p>
<p>Then indeed a silence fell. Jacqueline, too petrified to
embellish her statement, let her voice trail off into silence; Max,
folding&mdash;mechanically folding&mdash;the strands of hair,
offered neither disclaimer nor acceptance. With the force of the
inevitable the confession had struck home, and deep within him was
the strong soul's respect for the inevitable.</p>
<p>"You have always known?" he said, slowly, when the silence had
fulfilled itself. "You have always known&mdash;that I am a
woman?"</p>
<p>It sounded abominably crude, abominably banal&mdash;this tardy
question, and never had Max felt less feminine than in the uttering
of it.</p>
<p>The lips of Jacqueline quivered, her blue eyes brimmed with
tears of distress.</p>
<p>"Oh, I could wish myself dead!"</p>
<p>"And why?"</p>
<p>"Because I have made myself an imbecile!"</p>
<p>The humiliation, the self-contempt were so candid, so human,
that something changed in Max's face and the icy rigidity of pose
relaxed.</p>
<p>"Come here!"</p>
<p>The guilty child to the life, Jacqueline came timidly across the
room, the candlestick still drooping unhappily from her right hand,
the mysterious mug clutched in her left.</p>
<p>Max's first action was to take possession of both, and to set
them side by side upon the dressing-table. The candle Jacqueline
delivered up in silence, but as the mug was wrested from her, she
cried out in sudden vindictiveness:</p>
<p>"And that&mdash;look you&mdash;that is the cause of all! It was
Lucien's idea! I served a cup of <i>bouillon</i> to him and to his
friend at midnight, for they had talked much; and finding it good,
nothing would serve but I must place a cup also for Monsieur Max,
to await him on his return. Alas! Alas!"</p>
<p>Max pushed the cup away, as if to remove a side issue.</p>
<p>"Answer the question I put to you! You know that I am a
woman?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I know."</p>
<p>"Since when? Since the night at the Bal Tabarin?"</p>
<p>"Oh, but no!"</p>
<p>"Since the morning we met upon this doorstep?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Since the morning you made the coffee for M. Blake and me?"</p>
<p>Jacqueline was twisting the buckle of her belt in nervous
perturbation.</p>
<p>"Answer me! It was since that morning?"</p>
<p>"No! Yes! Oh, it was before that morning. Oh,
madame&mdash;monsieur!" She wrung her hands in a confusion of
misery. "Oh, do not torture me! I cannot tell you how it
was&mdash;or when. I cannot explain. You know how these things
come&mdash;from here!" She lightly touched the place where she
imagined her heart to be.</p>
<p>Max, sitting quiet, made no betrayal of the agony of
apprehension at work within.</p>
<p>"And how many others have had this&mdash;instinct? M. Cartel? M.
Blake?"</p>
<p>So surprising, so grotesque seemed the questions, that
self-confidence rushed suddenly in upon Jacqueline. She threw back
her head and laughed&mdash;laughed until her old inconsequent self
was restored to power.</p>
<p>"Lucien! Monsieur &Eacute;douard! Oh, <i>la, la</i>! How
droll!"</p>
<p>"Then they do not know?"</p>
<p>"Know? Are they not men? And are men not children?"</p>
<p>The vast superiority&mdash;the wordly wisdom in the babyish face
was at once so comical and so reassuring that irresistibly Max
laughed too; and at the laugh, the little Jacqueline dropped to her
knees beside the dressing-table and looked up, smiling,
radiant.</p>
<p>"I am forgiven?"</p>
<p>"I suppose so!"</p>
<p>"Then grant me a favor&mdash;one favor! Permit me to touch the
beautiful hair!"</p>
<p>Without waiting for the permission, the eager little hands
caught up the coiled strands, and in a moment the candlelight was
again chasing the red tints and the bronze through the dark
waves.</p>
<p>"My faith, but it is beautiful! Beautiful! And what a pity!"</p>
<p>"A pity&mdash;?"</p>
<p>"That no man may see it!" For an instant Jacqueline buried her
face in the silky mass; then, like a little bright bird, looked up
again. "A man would go mad for this!"</p>
<p>"For a thing like that? Absurd!"</p>
<p>"Yet a thing like that can demolish Monsieur Max, and leave in
his place&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"How shall I say? His sister?" She looked up anew, disarming in
her na&iuml;ve candor: and a swift temptation assailed her
listener&mdash;the temptation that at times assails the
strongest&mdash;the temptation to unburden the mind.</p>
<p>"Jacqueline," Max cried, impetuously, "you speak a great truth
when you say that! We have all of us the two natures&mdash;the
brother and the sister! Not one of us is quite woman&mdash;not one
of us is all man!"</p>
<p>The thought sped from him, winged and potent; and Jacqueline,
wise in her child's wisdom, offered no comment, put forward no
opinion.</p>
<p>"It is a war," Max cried again, "a relentless, eternal war; for
one nature must conquer, and one must fail. There cannot be two
rulers in the same city."</p>
<p>"No," Jacqueline murmured, discreetly, "that is most true."</p>
<p>"It is. Most true."</p>
<p>"Why, then, was madame adorning herself with her beautiful hair
when I had the unhappiness to enter? Has not madame already waged
her war&mdash;and conquered?"</p>
<p>The eyes were full of innocent question, the soft lips perfectly
grave.</p>
<p>Max paused to frame the falsehood that should fit the occasion;
but, like a flood-tide, the frankness, the courage of the boy
nature rose up, and the truth broke forth.</p>
<p>"I thought until to-night, Jacqueline, that the battle was won;
but to-night, while I supped with M. Blake, a little play was
played out before me&mdash;a little human play, where real people
played real parts, where the woman clung to her womanhood, as you
cling to yours, and the man to his manhood, as does M. Cartel;
where the stage effects were smiles and glances and eyes and
hair&mdash;"</p>
<p>Jacqueline nodded, but said not a word.</p>
<p>"And as I watched, the thought came to me&mdash;the mad thought,
that I had, perhaps, lost something&mdash;that I had, perhaps, put
something from me. Oh, it was a possession! A possession of some
evil spirit!"</p>
<p>Max sprang from the chair, and began to pace up and down the
shadowed room, while the little Jacqueline, sitting back upon her
heels in a stillness almost Oriental, watched, evolving some
thought of her own.</p>
<p>"And so madame desired to strangle the evil spirit with her
beautiful hair?"</p>
<p>The hurried steps ceased.</p>
<p>"I wished to see the woman in me&mdash;and to dismiss her!"</p>
<p>"And was she easily dismissed?"</p>
<p>The new question seemed curiously pregnant. Max heard it, and in
swift response came back again to the dressing-table, took the hair
from Jacqueline's hands and began again to intertwist it with the
boyish locks.</p>
<p>Jacqueline raised herself from her crouching position, the more
easily to gratify her curiosity.</p>
<p>"It is extraordinary&mdash;the change!" she murmured.
"Extraordinary! Madame, let us complete it! Let us remove that ugly
coat!" Excitedly, and without permission, she began to free Max of
the boy's coat, while Max yielded with a certain passive
excitement. "And, now, what can we find to substitute? Ah!" She
gave a cry of delight and ran to the bed, over the foot of which
was thrown a faded gold scarf&mdash;a strip of rich fabric such as
artists delight in, for which Max had bargained only the day before
in the rue Andr&eacute; de Sarte.</p>
<p>"Now the tie! And the ugly collar!" She ran back, the scarf
floating from her arm; and Max, still passive, still held mute by
conflicting sensations, suffered the light fingers to unloose the
wide black tie, to remove the collar, to open a button or two of
the shirt.</p>
<p>"And now the hair!" With lightning-like dexterity, Jacqueline
drew a handful of hairpins from her own head, reduced her short
blonde curls to confusion, and in a moment had brushed the thick
waves of Max's clipped hair upward and secured them into a firm
foundation.</p>
<p>"Now! Now, madame! Close your eyes! I am the magician!"</p>
<p>Max's eyes closed, and the illusion of dead hours rose again,
more vivid, more poignant than before. With the familiar sensation
of deft fingers at work upon the business of hairdressing, a
thousand recollections of countless nights and
mornings&mdash;countless preparations and
wearinesses&mdash;countless anticipations and disgusts, born with
the placing of each hairpin, the coiling of the
unfamiliar&mdash;familiar&mdash;weight of hair.</p>
<p>"Now, madame! Is it not a picture?"</p>
<p>With the gesture and pride of an artist, Jacqueline cast the
wide scarf round Max's shoulders and stepped back.</p>
<p>Max's eyes opened, gazing straight into the mirror, and once
again in that night of contrasts, emotion rose paramount.</p>
<p>It was most truly a picture; not the earlier, puzzling
sketch&mdash;the anomalous mingling of sex&mdash;but the complete
semblance of the woman&mdash;the slim neck rising from the golden
folds, the proud head, seeming smaller under its coiled hair than
it had ever appeared in the untidiness of its boy's locks.</p>
<p>"And now, madame, tell me! Is the evil spirit one lightly to be
dismissed?"</p>
<p>All the woman in the little Jacqueline&mdash;the creature of
eternal tradition, eternal intrigue&mdash;was glorying in her
handiwork, in the consciousness of its potency.</p>
<p>But Max never answered; Max continued to stare into the
glass.</p>
<p>"You will dismiss it, madame?"</p>
<p>Max still stared, a peculiar light of thought shining and
wavering in the gray eyes.</p>
<p>"Madame, you will dismiss it?"</p>
<p>Max turned slowly.</p>
<p>"I will do more, Jacqueline. I will destroy it utterly."</p>
<p>"Madame!"</p>
<p>"I have a great idea."</p>
<p>"Madame!"</p>
<p>"If a spirit&mdash;no matter how evil&mdash;could be
materialized, it would cease to affect the imagination. I shall
materialize mine!"</p>
<p>"Madame!"</p>
<p>"Yes; I have arrived at a conclusion. I shall render my evil
spirit powerless by materializing it. But I must first have a
promise from you; you must promise me to keep my secret."</p>
<p>"Madame&mdash;madame!" Jacqueline stammered.</p>
<p>"You will promise?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And how am I to trust you?"</p>
<p>Jacqueline's blue eyes went round and round the room, in search
of some overwhelming proof of her fidelity; then swiftly they
returned to Max's.</p>

<h5>THE COMPLETE SEMBLANCE OF THE WOMAN</h5>
<p>"Not even to Lucien, madame, shall it be revealed!" And silently
Max nodded, realizing the greatness of the pledge.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Many hours later, when all the lights were out in the rue
M&uuml;ller and all the doors wore closed, the slight figure of the
boy Max might have been seen by any belated wanderer slipping down
the Escalier de Sainte-Marie to post a letter&mdash;a letter that
had cost much thought, and upon which had been dropped many blots
of ink; and had the belated wanderer been possessed of occult
powers and wished to probe inside the envelope, the words he would
have read were these&mdash;scrawled with bold impetuosity:</p>
<div class='blkquot'>
<p><i>Mon Ami</i>,&mdash;My idea&mdash;the true idea&mdash;has come
to me. It was born in the first hour of this new day, and with it
has come the knowledge that, either you were right and some artists
need solitude, or I am one of the fools I talked of yesterday!</p>
<p>All this means that I am ill of the fever of work, and that for
many, many days&mdash;many, many weeks&mdash;I shall be in my
studio&mdash;locked away even from you.</p>
<p>Think no unkind thing of me! All my friendship is
yours&mdash;and all my thought. Be not jealous of my work!
Understand! Oh, Ned, understand! And know me, for ever and for
ever, your boy.</p>
<p>MAX.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">OF all the ills that circumstance forces upon
man, separation from a beloved object is, perhaps, the most
salutary. Separation is the crucible wherein love undergoes the
test absolute; in the fire of loss, grief softens to indifference
or hardens to enduring need.</div>
<p>The pale blue sky of May smiled upon Montmartre. The shrubs in
the plantation shimmered forth in green garments, the news-vender
by the gate, the little old Basque peasant woman telling her beads
in the shade of a holly-tree, even the children screaming at play
on the gravelled pathway, were touched with the charm of the hour.
Or so it seemed to Max&mdash;Max, <i>debonair</i> of
carriage&mdash;Max, hastening to a <i>rendezvous</i> with
fast-beating heart and nerves that throbbed alternately to a wild
joy of anticipation and a ridiculous, self-conscious dread.</p>
<p>How he had counted upon the moment! How he had loved and feared
it in ardent, varying imagination! And now, that it had at last
arrived, how hopelessly his prearranged actions eluded him, how
humanly his rehearsed sentences failed to marshal themselves for
speech! As he climbed up the plantation, dazzled by the sun,
intoxicated by the budding summer, he felt the merest
unsophisticated youth&mdash;the merest novice, dumb and impotent
under his own emotions.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, all self-distrust&mdash;even all
self-consciousness&mdash;was reft from him and he stood quite
still, the blood burning his face, a strange sensation contracting
his throat.</p>
<p>"At last! After a hundred thousand years!"</p>
<p>The first impression that fled across his mind was the intense
familiarity of Blake's voice&mdash;the delightful familiarity of
Blake's phrasing; the second, the brimming joy of regained
companionship.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon ami! Cher ami!"</i></p>
<p>His hands went out and were caught in Blake's; and all existence
became a mirror to the blue, smiling sky.</p>
<p>No further word was said; Blake took possession of his arm in
the old, accustomed fashion, and silently&mdash;in that silence
which makes speech seem poor&mdash;they turned and began to pace up
and down the gravelled path.</p>
<p>There was nothing beautiful in the plantation of the
Sacr&eacute;-Coeur; the shrubs, for all their valor of green, were
slight things if one thought of forest trees, the grass was a mere
pretence of grass. But the human mind is a great magician, weaving
glories from within, and neither Blake nor Max had will for
anything but the moment set precisely as it was.</p>
<p>For the gift of the universe, Blake could not have told why the
mere holding of the boy's arm, the mere regulating of his pace to
his, filled him with such satisfaction; nor, for the same
magnificent bribe, could Max have explained the glow&mdash;the
all-sufficing sense of fulfilment, born of the physical
contact.</p>
<p>For long they paced up and down, wrapped in their cloak of
content; then some look, some movement brought the world back, and
Blake paused.</p>
<p>"What a selfish brute I am! What about the work? Tell me, is it
done?"</p>
<p>Max looked up, the sun discovering the little flecks of gold in
his gray eyes; Max laughed from sheer happiness.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon ami!</i> But absolutely I had forgotten! Figure it to
yourself! I came out of the house, hot and cold for my poor
picture, and immediately we met&mdash;" He laughed again. "<i>Mon
ami</i>! What a compliment to you!"</p>
<p>"It is done then&mdash;the great work?"</p>
<p>"Yes; it is finished."</p>
<p>"Then I must see it this minute&mdash;this minute&mdash;this
very minute!"</p>
<p>The definiteness of the tone was like the clasp of the arm, and
Max glowed anew. By a swift, emotional effort, he conjured up the
longings that had preyed upon him in his self-imposed
solitude&mdash;conjured them for the sheer joy of feeling them
evaporate before reality.</p>
<p>"It awaits you, <i>mon ami</i>!" He made a sweeping gesture, as
though he laid the world at his friend's feet. And Blake, noting
this, noted also with an odd little sense of gratification, that
Max's English was a trifle more halting&mdash;a trifle more stilted
for the break in their companionship.</p>
<p>Still arm in arm, they passed down the sloping pathway to the
gate, where the children still played shrilly and the old Basque
peasant still drowsed over her rosary beads. As they passed her,
Blake put his hand in his pocket and slipped a silver coin into her
fingers.</p>
<p>"They're so like my own people&mdash;these Basque peasants!" he
said, by way of excuse. "They always give me a warm feeling about
the heart."</p>
<p>The old woman looked up surprised, and both were attracted by
the picture she made against the dark holly-trees&mdash;- the brown
withered face, the astonishingly bright eyes like the eyes of a
bird, the spare, bent figure with its scrupulous cleanliness of
dress.</p>
<p>"The blessing of the good God rest upon you, monsieur!" she
said, solemnly. "And may He provide you with your heart's
desire!"</p>
<p>"And for me, <i>bonne m&egrave;re</i>?" Max broke in. "What for
me?"</p>
<p>The small bright eyes scanned the young face thoughtfully. "The
good God, monsieur, will take you where He means that you should
go!" Her thin lips closed, and she fell again to the telling of her
beads, her inner vision doubtless weaving the scenes of her
youth&mdash;the grave brown hills and sounding sea of her native
country.</p>
<p>"For the moment it would seem that the good God points a way to
the studio!" said Max, as they turned away. "<i>Mon ami</i>, I burn
and tremble at once! Suppose it is of no use&mdash;my picture?" He
stopped suddenly by the gate, to gaze with unpremeditated
consternation at Blake; and Blake, touched by the happy familiarity
of the action, laughed aloud.</p>
<p>"The same Max!" he cried. "The same, same Max! It's like turning
back to the first page of my little book. Come along! I have spirit
for anything to-day&mdash;even to tell you that you've made a
failure. Come along, boy! It's a great world, when all's said and
done! Come along! I'll race you up the steps!"</p>
<p>Laughing like a couple of children, they ran up the Escalier de
Sainte-Marie, smiled upon indulgently by the careless passers-by,
and entering the house, the race was continued up the polished
stairs.</p>
<p>At the door of the <i>appartement</i> Max came level with Blake,
his face glowing with excitement, his laughter broken by quick
breaths.</p>
<p>"Oh, Ned, no! No! You must not enter! I am to go first. I have
arranged it all. Ned, please!" He pulled Blake back and, opening
the door, passed into the little hall and on into the bare, bright
studio.</p>
<p>To Blake, following closely, the scene bore a striking
resemblance to another scene&mdash;to the occasion upon which Max
had blocked in, and then destroyed, his <i>cabaret</i>
picture&mdash;save that now the light was no longer the silvery
light of spring, but the pale gold radiance of a youthful
summer.</p>
<p>The impression came, but the impression was summarily erased,
for as he crossed the threshold, Max flew to him, his exuberance
suddenly dead, the trepidation of the artist enveloping him again,
chasing the blood from his cheeks.</p>
<p>"Oh, Ned! Dear Ned! If it is bad?" He caught and clung to
Blake's arm, restraining him forcibly. "Do not look! Wait one
moment! Just one little moment!"</p>
<p>Very gently Blake disengaged the clinging hands. "What a child
he is, after all! He shuts himself away and works like a
galley-slave and then, when the moment of justification
comes&mdash;! Nonsense, boy! I'm not a critic. Let me see!"</p>
<p>As in a dream, Max saw him walk round the easel and pause full
in front of it; in an agony of apprehension, a quaking eagerness,
he lived through the moment of silence; then at Blake's first words
the blood rushed singing to his ears.</p>
<p>"It's extraordinary! But who is it?"</p>
<p>"Extraordinary? Extraordinary?" In a wild onset of emotion, Max
caught but the one word. "Does that mean good&mdash;or does it mean
bad? Oh, <i>mon cher</i>, all that I have put into that picture!
Speak! Speak! Be cruel! It is all wrong? It is all bad?"</p>
<p>"Don't be a fool!" said Blake, harshly. "You know it's good. But
who is it? That's what I'm asking you. Who is it?"</p>
<p>Heedless, unstrung&mdash;half laughing, half crying&mdash;Max
ran across the room. "Oh, <i>mon ami</i>, how you terrified
me&mdash;I thought you had condemned it!"</p>
<p>But Blake's eyes were for the picture; the portrait of a woman
seated at a mirror&mdash;a portrait in which the delicate reflected
face looked out from its shadowing hair with a curious questioning
intentness, a fascinating challenge at once elusive and vital.</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>He spoke low and with a deliberate purpose; and at his tone
recklessness seized upon Max.</p>
<p>"A woman, <i>mon ami</i>! Just a woman!" He stiffened his
shoulders, threw up his head, like a child who would dare the
universe.</p>
<p>"Yes, but what woman?" With amazing suddenness Blake swung round
and fixed a searching glance upon him. "She's the living image of
you&mdash;but you with such a difference&mdash;"</p>
<p>He stopped as swiftly as he had begun, and in the silence Max
quailed under his glance. Out of the unknown, fear assailed him; it
seemed that under this mastering scrutiny his mask must drop from
him, his very garments be rent. In sudden panic his thought skimmed
possibilities like a circling bird and lighted upon the first-found
point of safety.</p>
<p>"She is my sister," he said, in a voice that shook a little.
"She is my sister&mdash;Maxine."</p>
<p>Blake's eyes still held his.</p>
<p>"But you never said you had a sister."</p>
<p>Max seized upon his bravado, flinging it round him as a
garment.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon ami</i>," he cried, "we are not all as confiding as you!
Besides, it is not given to us all to possess five aunts, seven
uncles, and twenty-four first cousins! If I have but one sister,
may I not guard her as a secret?"</p>
<p>He spoke fast; his eyes flashed with the old light, half
pleading, half impertinent, his chin was lifted with the old
defiant tilt. The effect was gained. Blake's severity fell from
him, and with a quick gesture of affection he caught him by the
shoulder.</p>
<p>"I'm well reproved!" he said. "Well reproved! 'Twas quite the
right way of telling me to mind my own affairs. And if she were
<i>my</i> sister&mdash;" He turned again to the picture, but as his
eyes met the mirrored eyes with their profound, inscrutable look,
his words broke off unaccountably.</p>
<p>"Yes, <i>mon ami</i>? If she were your sister&mdash;?" Max, with
eager, stealthy glance, was following his expressions.</p>
<p>But he did not answer; he stood lost in contemplation,
speculating, he knew not why, upon the question in the mirrored
face.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXIII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">THE studio was in darkness; the old leathern
arm-chair was drawn close to the window, and from its capacious
depths Blake looked down upon the lights of Paris, while Max,
leaning over the balcony, looked upward at the pale May stars
clustering like jewelled flowers in the garden of the sky.</div>
<p>They had finished dinner&mdash;a dinner cooked by Blake in the
little kitchen beyond the hall, and empty coffee-cups testified to
a meal enjoyed to its legitimate end. The sense of
solitude&mdash;of an intimate hour&mdash;lay upon the scene as
intangibly and as definitely as did the darkness; but Max, watching
the pageant of the stars, resting his light body against the iron
railing, was filled with a mental restlessness, the nervous
reaction of the day's triumph. More than once he glanced at Blake,
a little gleam of uncertainty flashing in his eyes, and more than
once his glance returned to the sky, as if seeking counsel of its
immensity.</p>
<p>Upon what point was Blake speculating? What were the thoughts at
work behind his silence? The questions tormented him like the
flicking of a whip, and he marked with an untoward jealousy the
profundity of Blake's calm&mdash;marked it until, goaded by a
sudden loneliness, he cried his fear aloud.</p>
<p>"Ned! You missed me in these weeks?"</p>
<p>Blake started, giving evidence of a broken dream. "Missed you,
boy?" he said, quietly. "I didn't know how much I missed you until
I saw you again to-day."</p>
<p>"And you have made no new friend?"</p>
<p>"Not a solitary one&mdash;man, woman, or child!"</p>
<p>The reply would have satisfied the most suspicious; and Max gave
a quick, deep sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"Ah! I thank God!"</p>
<p>In the darkness, Blake smiled, looking indulgently at the
youthful figure silhouetted against the sky. "Why are you so
absurd, boy?" he asked, gently. "Surely, I have proved myself!"</p>
<p>"Forgive me! I was jealous!" With one of his engaging impulses,
the boy straightened himself and came across the balcony. "I am a
strange creature, Ned! I want you altogether for myself&mdash;I
want to know you satisfied to be all mine!"</p>
<p>Blake looked up. "Do you know," he said, irrelevantly and a
little dreamily, "do you know that is just the speech I could
imagine issuing from the lips of your picture! Tell me something of
this mysterious sister of yours; I've been patient until now."</p>
<p>Max drew back into the darkness.</p>
<p>"Of my sister? There is nothing to tell!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense! There's always something to tell. It's the sense of a
story behind things that keeps half of us alive. Come! I've spun
you many a yarn." With the quiet air of the man who means to have
his way, he took out and lighted a cigar.</p>
<p>"Come, boy! I'm listening!"</p>
<p>Max had turned back to the railing, and once more he leaned out
into the night; but now his eyes were for the meshed lights of the
city and no longer for the stars, his restlessness had heightened
to excitement, his heart seemed to beat in his throat. The
temptation to make confession, to make confession here, isolated in
the midst of the world, with the friend of his soul for confessor,
caught him with the urgency of an embracing gale. To lay himself
bare, and yet retain his garments! His head swam, as he yielded to
the suggestion.</p>
<p>"There is nothing to tell!" he said again.</p>
<p>"That's admitted! All the best stories begin that way."</p>
<p>Max laughed and took a cigarette from his pocket. His nerves
were tingling, his blood racing to the thought of the precipice
upon which he stood. One false step and the fabric of his existence
was imperilled! The adventurer awoke in him alive and alert.</p>
<p>"She intrigues you, then&mdash;Maxine?"</p>
<p>"Marvellously&mdash;as the Sphinx intrigues me! To begin with,
why the name? You Max! She Maxine!"</p>
<p>For an instant Max scanned the dark plantation with knitted
brows; then he looked over his shoulder with a peculiar smile.</p>
<p>"We are twins, <i>mon cher!</i>" he said, taking secret joy in
the elaboration of his lie. "My mother was a Frenchwoman, by name
Maxine, and when she died at our birth, my father in his grief
bestowed the name upon us both&mdash;the boy and the girl&mdash;Max
and Maxine!" Very carefully he lighted his cigarette. His whole
nature was quivering to the dangers of this masked
confession&mdash;this dancing upon the edge of the precipice. "My
father was a man of ideas!" He carefully threw the match down into
the rue M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"Your father, I take it, was a personage of importance?" Blake
was momentarily sarcastic.</p>
<p>"A personage, yes," the boy admitted, "but that is not the
point. The point is that he was a man of ideas, who understood the
body and the soul. A man who trained a child in every outdoor sport
until it was one with nature, and then taught it to entrap nature
and bend her to the uses of art. He was very great&mdash;my
father!"</p>
<p>"He is dead?"</p>
<p>"Yes; he is dead. He died the year before Maxine married."</p>
<p>"Ah, she married?" Absurd as it might seem, there was a fleeting
shadow of disappointment discernible in Blake's voice.</p>
<p>"Yes, she married. After my father's death she went to my aunt
in Petersburg, and there she forgot both nature and art&mdash;and
me."</p>
<p>"And who was the man she married?"</p>
<p>Max shrugged his shoulders to the ears. "Does it serve any
purpose to relate? He was very charming, very accomplished; how was
my sister, at eighteen, to know that he was also very callous, very
profligate, very cruel? These things happen every day in every
country!"</p>
<p>"Did she love him?" Blake was leaning forward in his chair; he
had forgotten to keep his cigar alight.</p>
<p>"Love him?" With a vehemence electric as it was unheralded,
Max's voice altered; with the passionate changefulness of the
Russian, indifference was swept aside, emotion gushed forth. "Love
him? Yes, she loved him&mdash;she, who was as proud as God! She
loved him so that all her pride left her&mdash;all the high courage
of my father left her&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And he&mdash;the man, the husband?"</p>
<p>"The man?" Max laughed a short, bitter laugh unsuggestive of
himself. "The man did what every man does, my friend, when a woman
lies down beneath his feet&mdash;he spurned her away."</p>
<p>"But, my God, a creature like that!"</p>
<p>Again Max laughed. "Yes! That is what you all say of the woman
who is not beneath your own heel! You wonder why I disapprove of
love. That is the reason of my disapproval&mdash;the story of my
sister Maxine! Maxine who was as fine and free as a young animal,
until love snared her and its instrument crushed her."</p>
<p>"But the man&mdash;the husband?" said Blake again.</p>
<p>"The man? The man followed the common way, dragging her with
him&mdash;step by step, step by step&mdash;down the sickening road
of disillusionment&mdash;down that steep, steep road that is bitter
as the Way of the Cross!"</p>
<p>"Boy!"</p>
<p>"I shock you? You have not travelled that road! You have not
seen the morass at the bottom! You have not seen the creature you
loved stripped of every garment that you wove&mdash;as has my
sister Maxine! You do well to be shocked. You have not been left
with a scar upon your heart; you have not viewed the last black
picture of all&mdash;the picture of your beloved as a dead
thing&mdash;dead over some affair of passion so sordid that even
horror turns to disgust. You do well to be shocked!"</p>
<p>"Dead?" repeated Blake, caught by the sound of the word. "He
died, then?"</p>
<p>"He killed himself." Max laughed harshly. "Killed himself when
all the wrong was done!"</p>
<p>"And your sister? Your sister? Where did she go&mdash;what did
she do?"</p>
<p>"What does a woman do when she is thrown up like wreckage after
the storm?"</p>
<p>"She does as her temperament directs. I think your sister would
go back to nature&mdash;to the great and simple things."</p>
<p>With a tense swiftness the boy turned from his fixed
contemplation of the sky, his glance flashing upon Blake.</p>
<p>"One must be naked and whole to go back to nature! One fears
nature when one is wreckage from the storm!"</p>
<p>"Then she turned to art?"</p>
<p>"No, my friend! No! Art, like nature, exacts&mdash;and she had
already given! She was too frightened&mdash;too hurt to meddle with
great things. She dried her tears before they had time to fall; she
hardened her heart, and went back to the world that gives nothing
and exacts nothing."</p>
<p>"Poor child!" said Blake. "Poor child!"</p>
<p>"She went back to the world&mdash;and the world poured oil on
her wounds, and soothed her fears and taught her its smiling,
shallow ways."</p>
<p>"Poor child!"</p>
<p>The reiterated word had a curious effect upon the boy; his
fierceness dropped from him; he turned again to the railing and,
looking upward, seemed to drench himself in the coolness of the
starlight.</p>
<p>"For years she lived her shallow life. She took lightly the
light gifts the world offered; among those gifts was
love&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Stop!" cried Blake, involuntarily. "You are tarnishing the
picture!"</p>
<p>"I am only painting in crude colors! Much love was offered
lightly to Maxine, and she took it&mdash;lightly; then one day her
friend the world brought for her consideration a suitor more
powerful, more distinguished, even less exigent than the
rest&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Stop! Stop!" cried Blake, again. "I can't see her as this hard
woman. She frightens me!"</p>
<p>"She has sometimes frightened me," said Max, enigmatically, "but
that is outside the picture. She took, as I tell you, with both
hands, smiling very wisely to herself, holding her head very high.
But when the head is held too high, the feet sometimes fall into a
trap. It came suddenly&mdash;the trapping of my sister Maxine."</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes! Tell me!"</p>
<p>"I am telling you, my friend! The date of Maxine's marriage was
fixed, and she moved through her world content. One night a great
court function was held; she was present, her <i>fianc&eacute;</i>
was present, the atmosphere was all congratulation&mdash;like honey
and wine. When it was over, the <i>fianc&eacute;</i> begged the
privilege of escorting her to her home, and they drove together
through the cold Russian night. They spoke little; Maxine's
thoughts skimmed lightly over the future, her hands lay lightly in
her <i>fianc&eacute;'s</i>. All was unemotional&mdash;all was
smooth and undisturbed&mdash;until they reached the street where
her house stood; then, with the swiftness that belongs to mad
moments, the being beside her showed himself. Quick as a flash of
lightning, the dignified, distinguished, unexacting lover was
effaced, and in his place was a man&mdash;an animal&mdash;a
passionate egoist! He caught her in his arms, and his arms were
like iron bands; his lips pressed hers, and they were like a flame.
In a flash, the fabric of her illusions was scattered. She saw the
truth. The world had cheated her, this second marriage was to be as
the first. Terror seized my sister Maxine&mdash;terror of life,
terror of herself. Her false calm broke up, as the ice breaks under
the hand of spring&mdash;wells of fear gushed in her heart. She
dismissed her lover at the gateway of her house; he guessed
nothing&mdash;he knew nothing but that her hands were shaking and
that her face was white, but when he was gone she rushed to her own
room, cast off all her jewels, wrapped herself in a fur cloak and
commanded her sledge and her swiftest horses."</p>
<p>"Boy!" cried Blake. "What a situation!"</p>
<p>"She drove, drove for hours, feeling nothing of the biting cold,
seeing nothing of the imprisoning white world about her, goaded by
one idea&mdash;the terror of life&mdash;the terror of giving
herself again&mdash;"</p>
<p>"She fled," cried Blake, with sudden intuition. "She never
returned to Petersburg!" He had risen from his chair; he was
supremely, profoundly interested.</p>
<p>"She never returned to her own house. Three days after that wild
drive she left Russia&mdash;left Russia and came&mdash;"</p>
<p>"To you!" cried Blake. "What a superb situation! She came back
to you&mdash;the companion of her youth&mdash;to you, adventuring
here in your own odd way! Oh, boy, it's great!"</p>
<p>"It is strange&mdash;yes!" said Max, suddenly curbing
himself.</p>
<p>"Strange? It's stupendous!" Blake caught him by the shoulder,
wheeling him round, looking straight into his face. "Boy! You know
what I'm going to ask? You know what I'm wanting with all my heart
and soul?"</p>
<p>The pressure of his hand was hard; he was the Blake of rare
moments&mdash;the Blake roused from nonchalant good-nature into
urgency of purpose. Max felt a doubt, a thin, wavering fear flutter
across his mind.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon cher</i>," he stammered, "I do not know. How could I
know?"</p>
<p>"It's this, then! With all my heart and soul I want to know this
sister of yours."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">IT came sharply, as the crash of a breaking
vessel might come to the ear&mdash;this ring of reality in Blake's
voice! Abruptly, unpleasantly, Max came back to the world and the
consequences of his act.</div>
<p>Impressions and instincts spring to the artist mind; in a moment
he was armored for self-preservation&mdash;so straitly armored that
every sentiment, even the vague-stirring jealousy of himself that
had been given sudden birth, was overridden and cast into the
dark.</p>
<p>With the old hauteur, the old touch of imperiousness, he
returned Blake's glance.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon ami</i>," he said, gravely, "what you desire is
impossible."</p>
<p>Only a moment had intervened between Blake's declaration and his
reply, but it seemed to him that the universe had reeled and
steadied again in that brief interval.</p>
<p>"And why impossible?"</p>
<p>Again it was the atmosphere of their first meeting&mdash;the boy
hedged behind his pride, the man calmly breaking a way through that
hedge.</p>
<p>Max shrugged. "The word is final. It explains itself."</p>
<p>With a conciliatory, affectionate movement, Blake's hand slipped
from his shoulder to his arm. "Don't be absurd, boy," he said,
gently. "Nothing on God's earth is impossible. 'Impossibility' is a
word coined by weak people behind which to shelter. Why may I not
know your sister?"</p>
<p>Max drew away his arm, not ostentatiously, but with definite
purpose.</p>
<p>"Can you not understand without explanation&mdash;you, who
comprehend so well?"</p>
<p>"Frankly, I cannot."</p>
<p>"My sister is in Paris secretly. She would think it very ill of
me to discuss her affairs&mdash;"</p>
<p>Blake looked quickly into the cold face. "I wonder if she would,
boy?" he said. "I think I'll go and see!" With perfect seriousness
he stepped back into the studio, struck a match, lighted a candle
and walked deliberately to the easel, while Max, upon the balcony,
held his breath in astonishment.</p>
<p>For long he stood before the portrait; then at last he spoke,
and his words were as unexpected as his action had been.</p>
<p>"She loves you, boy?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Loves me? Oh, of course!" Max was startled into the reply.</p>
<p>"Then 'twill be all right!" With a touch of finality he blew out
his candle and came back to the balcony. "It will be all right, or
I'm no judge of human nature! That woman could be as proud as
Lucifer where she disliked or despised, but she'd be all
toleration, all generosity where her love was touched. Tell her I'm
your friend and, believe me, she'll ask no other passport to her
favor."</p>
<p>Max, standing in the darkness&mdash;eager of glance, quick of
thought, acutely attentive to every tone of Blake's
voice&mdash;suddenly became cognizant of his demon of jealousy,
felt its subtle stirring in his heart, its swift spring from heart
to throat. A wave of blood surged to his face and receded, leaving
him pale and trembling, but with the intense self-possession
sometimes born of such moments, he stepped into the studio and
relighted the candle Blake had blown out.</p>
<p>"Why are you so anxious to know my sister?" His voice was
measured&mdash;it gave no suggestion either of pleasure or of
pain.</p>
<p>Blake, unsuspicious, eager for his own affairs, followed him
into the room.</p>
<p>"I can't define the desire," he said; "I feel that I'd find
something wonderful behind that face; I feel that"&mdash;he paused
and laughed a little&mdash;"that somehow I should find <i>you</i>
transfigured and idealized and grown up."</p>
<p>"It is the suggestion of me that intrigues you?"</p>
<p>"I suppose it is&mdash;in a subtle way!" He glanced up, to
accentuate his words, but surprise seized him at sight of the boy's
white, passionate face. "Why, Max, boy! What's the matter?"</p>
<p>Max made a quick gesture, sweeping the words aside. "I am not
sufficient to you?"</p>
<p>Blake stared. "I don't understand."</p>
<p>"Yet I speak your own tongue! I say 'I am not sufficient to
you?' I have given you my friendship&mdash;my heart and my mind,
but I am not sufficient to you? Something more is
required&mdash;something else&mdash;something different!"</p>
<p>"Something more? Something different?"</p>
<p>"Yes! In this world it is always the outward seeming! I may have
as much personality as my sister Maxine; I may be as interesting,
but you do not inquire. Why? Why? Because I am a boy&mdash;she a
woman!"</p>
<p>Blake, uncertain how to answer this cataract of words, took
refuge in banter.</p>
<p>"Don't be fantastical!" he said. "We are not holding a debate on
sex. If we are to be normal, we must declare that man and woman
don't compare!"</p>
<p>"Now you are gambling with words! I desire facts. It is a fact
that until to-day I was enough&mdash;friend enough&mdash;companion
enough&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My child!"</p>
<p>But Max rushed on, lashing himself to rage.</p>
<p>"I was enough; but now you desire more. And why? Why? Not
because you discern more in the new personality, but because it
appeals to you as the personality of a woman. There is nothing
deeper&mdash;nothing more in the affair&mdash;no other reason, as
you yourself would say, upon God's earth!" He ended abruptly; his
arms fell to his sides; his voice held in it a sound perilously
like a sob.</p>
<p>Blake looked at him in surprise.</p>
<p>"My good boy," he said, "you're forgetting the terms of our
friendship; to my knowledge they never included hysterics."</p>
<p>The tonic effect of the words was supreme; the sob was strangled
in Max's throat; a swift, pained certainty came to him that Blake
would not have spoken these words in the plantation that morning,
would not have spoken them as they raced together up the Escalier
de Sainte-Marie.</p>
<p>"I understand, <i>mon ami</i>!" he said, tensely. "I understand
so perfectly that, were you dying, and were this request your last,
I would refuse it! I hope I have explained myself!"</p>
<p>The tone was bitter and contemptuous, it succeeded in stinging
Blake. Up to that moment he had played with the affair; now the
play became earnest, his own temper was stirred.</p>
<p>"Thanks, boy!" he said; "but when I'm dying I'll hope for an
archangel to attend to my wants&mdash;not a little cherub.
Good-night to you!" Without look or gesture of farewell, he picked
up his hat and walked out of the room.</p>
<p>Once before this thing had happened; once before Max had heard
the closing of the door, and known the blank isolation following
upon it. But then weeks of close companionship, weeks of growing
affection had preceded the moment, giving strength for its
endurance; now it came hot upon a long abstinence from friendship,
an abstinence made doubly poignant by one day's complete
reunion.</p>
<p>For a moment he stood&mdash;pride upon his right hand, love upon
his left; for a moment he stood, waging his secret war, then with
amazing suddenness, the issue was decided, he capitulated
shamelessly. Pride melted into the night and love caught him in a
quick embrace.</p>
<p>Lithe and silent as some creature of the forest, he was across
the studio and down the stairs, his mind tense, his desires fixed
upon one point.</p>
<p>Blake was crossing the dim hallway as the light feet skimmed the
last slippery steps; he paused in answer to a swift, eager
call.</p>
<p>"Ned! Ned! Wait! Ned, I want you!"</p>
<p>Blake paused; in the dim light it was not possible to read his
face, but something in the outline of his figure, in the rigidity
and definiteness of his stopping, chilled the boy with a sense of
antagonism.</p>
<p>"Ned! Ned!" He ran to him, caught and clung to his arm, put
forth all his wiles.</p>
<p>"Ned, you are angry! Why are you angry?"</p>
<p>"I am not angry; I am disappointed." Some strange wall of
coldness, at once intangible and impenetrable, had risen about
Blake. In fear the boy beat vain hands against it.</p>
<p>"You are disappointed, Ned&mdash;in me?"</p>
<p>"I am."</p>
<p>"And why? Why?"</p>
<p>"Because you have behaved like a little fool."</p>
<p>In themselves, the words were nothing, but Blake's tone was
serious.</p>
<p>"And&mdash;because of that&mdash;you are disappointed?"</p>
<p>Max's voice undeniably shook; and the fates, peering into the
dark hallway, smiled as they pushed the little human comedy nearer
the tragic verge.</p>
<p>"I am," answered Blake, with cruel deliberateness. "I thought
until to-night that you were a reasonable being&mdash;a bit
elusive, perhaps&mdash;a bit wayward and tantalizing&mdash;but
still a reasonable being. Now&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Now?" Suddenly Max had a sensation of being very small, very
insignificant; suddenly he had an impression of Blake as a denizen
of a wider world, where other emotions than laughter and
comradeship held place&mdash;and his heart trembled
unreasonably.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>mon cher</i>!" he cried. "Forgive me! Forgive me! Say I
am still your boy! Say it! Say it!"</p>
<p>Truth lent passion to his voice&mdash;false passion Blake
esteemed it, and the cold, imaginary wall became more
impregnable.</p>
<p>"That'll do, Max! Heroics are no more attractive to me than
hysterics. Good-night to you!" He freed his arm and turned to the
door.</p>
<p>In the darkness, Max threw out both hands in despairing
appeal.</p>
<p>"Ned! Oh, Ned!" he called. But only the sound of Blake's
retreating steps responded. And here was no merciful intervention
of gods and mortals, to make good the evil hour; no pretty, tactful
Jacqueline, no M. Cartel with his magic fiddle. Only the dim hall,
the lonely stairway, the open door with its vision of cold, pale
stars and whispering trees.</p>
<p>His misery was a tangible thing. Like a lost child, obsessed by
its own fears, he bent under the weight of his sorrow; he sank down
upon the lowest step of the stairs and, resting his head against
the banister, broke into pitiful, silent tears.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXV'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">IT was the morning after the reunion&mdash;the
morning after the catastrophe, and Blake was breakfasting alone in
his rooms.</div>
<p>Typically Parisian rooms they were, rooms that stood closed and
silent for more than half the year and woke to offer him a welcome
when his wandering footsteps turned periodically toward Paris;
typically Parisian, with their long windows and stiffly draped
curtains, their marble mantelpieces and gilt-framed mirrors, their
furniture arranged with a suggestion of ancient formality that by
its very rigidity soothed the eye.</p>
<p>At the moment, evidences of Blake's unusually long occupancy
broke this stiffness in many directions; intimate trifles that
speak a man's presence were strewn here and there&mdash;objects of
utility, objects of value and interest gathered upon his last long
journey. Eminently pleasant the <i>salon</i> appeared in the
sunshine of the May morning&mdash;full of air and light, its gray
carpet and gray-panelled walls making an agreeably neutral setting
to the household gods of a gentleman of leisure. But the gentleman
in question, so agreeably situated, seemed to find his state less
gratifying than it might appear; a sense of dissatisfaction
possessed him, as he sat at his solitary meal, a sense of dulness
and loss most tenacious of hold.</p>
<p>More than once he roundly called himself a fool; more than once
he shook out the thin sheets of his morning paper and buried
himself in their contents, but unavailingly. The feeling of
flatness, the sense of dissatisfaction with the world as it stood,
grew instead of diminishing. At last, throwing down the paper, he
gave up the unequal struggle and yielded to the pessimistic
pleasure of self-analysis. He recalled last night and its vexatious
trend of events, and with something akin to shame, he remembered
his anger against Max; but although he admitted its possible
exaggeration, the admission brought no palliation of Max's offence.
He, possibly, had behaved like a brute; but Max had behaved like an
imbecile!</p>
<p>At this point, he fell to staring fixedly in front of him, and
through the meshes of his day-dream floated a face&mdash;not the
face of the boy he was condemning, but that of the mysterious cause
of last night's calamity.</p>
<p>He conjured it with quite astonishing vividness&mdash;the face
of the portrait&mdash;the face so like, so unlike, the boy's. Every
detail of the picture assailed him; the subtle illusion of the
mirror&mdash;the strange, reflected eyes propounding their
riddle.</p>
<p>Looking in imagination into those eyes, he lost himself
delightfully. Sensations, periods of time passed and repassed in
his brain&mdash;speculation, desire, and memory danced an
enchanting, tangled measure.</p>
<p>He recalled the hundred fancies that had held, or failed to hold
him in his thirty-eight years; he recalled the women who had loved
too little, the women who had loved too much; and, quick upon the
recollection, came the consciousness of the disillusion that had
inevitably followed upon adventure.</p>
<p>He did not ask himself why these dreams should stir, why these
ghosts should materialize and kiss light hands to him in the blue
brilliance of this May morning; he realized nothing but that behind
them all&mdash;a reality in a world of shadows&mdash;he saw the
eyes of the picture insistently propounding their riddle&mdash;the
riddle, the question that from youth upward had rankled,
inarticulate, in his own soul.</p>
<p>It arose now, renewed, with his acknowledgment of it&mdash;the
troubling, insistent question that cries in every human brain,
sometimes softly, like a child sobbing outside a closed door,
sometimes loudly and terribly, like a man in agony. The eternal
question ringing through the ages.</p>
<p>He recognized it, clear as the spoken word, in this unknown
woman's gaze; and for the first time in all his life the desire to
make answer quickened within him. He, who had invariably sought,
invariably questioned, suddenly craved to make reply!</p>
<p>An incurable dreamer, the fancy took him and he yielded to its
glamour. How delightful to know and study that exquisite face! How
fascinating beyond all words to catch the fleeting semblance of his
charming Max&mdash;to lose it in the woman's seriousness&mdash;to
touch it again in some gleam of boyish humor! It was a quaint
conceit, apart from, untouched by any previous experience. Its
subtlety possessed him; existence suddenly took on form and
purpose; the depression, the sense of loss dispersed as morning
clouds before the sun.</p>
<p>He rose, forgetful of his unfinished meal, his vitality
stirring, his curiosity kindling as it had not kindled for
years.</p>
<p>What, all things reckoned, stood between him and this alluring
study? A boy! A mere boy!</p>
<p>No thought came to him of the boy himself&mdash;the instrument
of the desire. No thought came; for every human creature is a pure
egoist in the first stirring of a passion, and stalks his quarry
with blind haste, fearful that at any turn he may be balked by time
or circumstance. Later, when grief has chastened, or joy cleansed
him, the altruist may peep forth, but never in the primary
moment.</p>
<p>With no thought of the clinging hands and beseeching voice of
last night&mdash;with no knowledge of a mournful figure that had
dragged itself up the stairway of the house in the rue M&uuml;ller
and sobbed itself to sleep in a lonely bed, he walked across the
room to his writing-table and calmly picked up a pen.</p>
<p>He dipped the pen into the ink and selected a sheet of
note-paper; then, as he bent to write, impatience seized him, he
tore the paper across and took up a telegraph form.</p>
<p>On this he wrote the simple message:</p>
<div class='blkquot'>
<p>Will you allow me to meet your sister?&mdash;NED.</p>
</div>
<p>It was brief, it was informal, it was entirely unjustifiable.
But what circumstance in his relation to the boy had lent itself
either to formality or justification?</p>
<p>He rang the bell, dispatched his message, and then sat down to
wait.</p>
<p>His attitude in that matter of waiting was entirely
characteristic. He did not arrange his action in the event of
defeat; he did not speculate upon probable triumph. The affair had
passed out of his hands; the future was upon the knees of the
gods!</p>
<p>He did not finish his breakfast in that time of probation; he
did not again take up the paper he had thrown aside. He made no
effort to occupy or to amuse himself; he merely waited, and in due
time the gods gave him a sign&mdash;a telegraphic message, brief
and concise as his own:</p>
<div class='blkquot'>
<p>Come to-night at ten. She will be here.&mdash;MAX.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">AT ten o'clock, punctual to the moment, Blake
walked up the Escalier de Sainte-Marie. All day a curious agitation
compounded of elation and impatience had lifted him as upon wings,
but now that the hour had arrived, doubt amounting almost to
reluctance assailed his spirit. He walked slowly, looking about him
as though the way were strange; outside the house in the rue
M&uuml;ller he paused and glanced up at the fifth floor, suddenly
daunted, suddenly thrilled by the faint light coming mistily
through the open windows of the <i>salon</i> and the studio.</div>
<p>What would she be like&mdash;this sister of Max? He strove
ineffectually to materialize the portrait, but it eluded him. Only
the soul of the woman seemed to have place in his
imagination&mdash;the soul, seen through the questioning eyes.</p>
<p>Still a victim to the strange, new reticence, he entered the
open doorway and began the familiar ascent. Here again the thought
of the woman obsessed him. How must this place appear to her? His
thoughts touched the varying scenes of Max's story&mdash;scenes of
the girl's free youth and sumptuous, exotic after-life. None fitted
accurately with a rue M&uuml;ller. Of a certainty she, as well as
the boy, must have the adventuring spirit!</p>
<p>His senses stirred, routing his diffidence, and under their spur
he ran up the remaining steps, only pausing at the fifth floor as a
light voice hailed him out of the dusk, a little flitting figure
darted from the shadows, and Jacqueline, brimming with suppressed
excitement, caught him by the arm.</p>
<p>"Monsieur &Eacute;douard!"</p>
<p>He laughed in recognition and greeting. "Well, Jacqueline!
Always the air of the grand secret! Always the air of the little
bird that has discovered the topmost bough of the tree! What is it
to-night?"</p>
<p>His feelings were running riot; it was agreeable to spend them
in badinage. But Jacqueline slapped his hand in reproof.</p>
<p>"No pleasantries, monsieur! The affair is serious."</p>
<p>He smiled; he lowered his voice to the tone of hers. "You have a
visitor, then, Jacqueline, to this fifth floor of yours?"</p>
<p>Jacqueline nodded her blonde head, and again her excitement
brimmed full measure.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, she is here&mdash;the sister of M. Max! The
princess!" She whispered the last word&mdash;a whisper delicious,
tremulous with the weight of actual romance.</p>
<p>Blake heard it, and his own heart stirred to a joyous youthful
sensation. It was so na&iuml;ve, so charming, so absolutely
French.</p>
<p>"The princess!" he whispered back in just the expected tone.
"Jacqueline, is she beautiful?"</p>
<p>Jacqueline threw up her hands, invoked heaven with her eyes,
earth with her shrugging shoulders.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, she is ravishing!"</p>
<p>Blake's expressive answer was to put her gently aside and step
toward Max's door.</p>
<p>But she was after him with a little cry. "Monsieur, not yet! I
must deliver my message! The message of M. Max!"</p>
<p>"Of M. Max?"</p>
<p>"But yes, monsieur!" Her hands, her whole body expressed apology
and eager explanation. "M. Max has been called away&mdash;upon a
business of much importance. M. Max desires his profoundest, his
most affectionate excuses&mdash;and will monsieur place him under a
debt never possible of repayment by entering the
<i>appartement</i>&mdash;by entertaining the princess during his
absence?"</p>
<p>Blake stared "In the name of Heaven&mdash;"</p>
<p>But Jacqueline's white hands again made free with his arm.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, Heaven will arrange! Heaven is bountiful in these
affairs!"</p>
<p>"But I don't understand. He has gone upon business, you say? He
never had any business."</p>
<p>Jacqueline laughed and clapped her hands. "Do not be too sure,
monsieur! He is growing up, is M. Max!" She gave another little
twittering laugh of sheer delight.</p>
<p>"Come, monsieur! The princess is alone. It is not gallant to
keep a lady waiting!"</p>
<p>"But you don't understand, Jacqueline. It is
impossible&mdash;impossible that I should intrude&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It is no intrusion, monsieur! I have explained everything to
madame&mdash;and she expects you!" She flitted past him to the
door, threw it open and dropped him a pretty, impertinent
curtsy.</p>
<p>"Now, monsieur!" she commanded; and Blake, half amused, half
resentful, saw nothing for it but to obey.</p>
<p>He stepped across the threshold; he heard Jacqueline laugh again
softly and close the door; then he stood, a prey to profound
trepidation.</p>
<p>He stood for a moment, hesitating between flight and advance,
then shame at his weakness forced him to go forward and open the
<i>salon</i> door.</p>
<p>As he opened it, another change took place within him; his
diffidence forsook him, his excitement was allayed as, by a
restraining hand, he was dominated by a peculiar clarity of
vision.</p>
<p>This accentuated keenness of observation came into action even
in a material sense; as he passed into the familiar room, each
object appealed to him in its appointed place&mdash;in its just and
proper value. The quaint odd articles of furniture that he and Max
had chosen in company! The pictures that he had hung upon the white
walls at Max's bidding! The Russian <i>samovar</i>, the books, the
open cigarette-box, each of which spoke and breathed of Max!</p>
<p>Every object came to him clearly in the quiet light of the lamp
upon the bureau; it seemed like the setting of a play, where the
atmosphere had been carefully created, the details definitely woven
into a perfect chain.</p>
<p>He stood, looking upon the silent room, wondering what would
happen&mdash;convinced that something must happen; and at last,
with the same quietness&mdash;the same intense naturalness, perfect
as extreme art&mdash;a slight sound came from the balcony and a
woman stepped into the subdued light.</p>
<p>She stepped into the quiet lamplight and paused; and Blake's
first subconscious feeling was that, miraculously, the empty room
had taken on life and meaning&mdash;that this sudden, gracious
presence filled and possessed it absolutely and by right
divine.</p>
<p>She seemed very tall as she stood looking down into the room,
her rich hair crowning her head, her young figure clothed in white
and wrapped in a cloak of soft mysterious gray that fell from her
shoulders simply, yet with the dignity of a royal mantle.</p>
<p>She stood for a full minute, looking at him, almost it seemed
sharing his own uncertainty; then, with a little gesture that
irresistibly conjured Max, she stepped into the room&mdash;and into
his life.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," she said, very softly, "I am the sister of Max; you
are his friend. It is surely meant that we know each other!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">IT was a perfect moment; one of those rare and
delicate spaces of time in which Fate's fingers seem to strike a
chord at once poignant and satisfying, faint and far-reaching. The
lamp-lit room, the open window and, beyond, the balcony veiled in
the obscurity of the night! It was a fair setting for romance; and
romance, young, beautiful, gracious as in the fairy-tale, had
emerged from it into Blake's life. A smile, a word&mdash;and an
atmosphere had been created! The things of the past were obscured,
and the things of the present made omnipotent.</div>
<p>"What a brother this is of mine!" Maxine smiled again with a
little quiver of humor that set her eyes alight. "Is it not like
him to invite me to criticise my portrait, and leave me to receive
his friend?"</p>
<p>She spoke, not in the English which Max invariably used, but in
French; and the sound of her voice entangled Blake's senses. It
seemed the boy's voice at its lowest and tenderest, but touched
with new inflections tantalizing as they were delightful.
Self-consciousness fled before it; he was at one with the sister as
he had been at one with the brother on the crisp white morning when
comradeship had been sealed to the marching of soldiers' feet and
the rattle of fife and drum.</p>
<p>"Princess," he said, "I shall be as frank as Max himself would
be! The situation is overwhelming; do with me what you will! If I
intrude, dismiss me! I know how fascinating solitude on this
balcony can be."</p>
<p>She smiled again, but gravely with a hint of the portrait's
mystery.</p>
<p>"Solitude is an excellent thing, monsieur, but to-night I think
I need the solace of a fellow-being. Will you not stay and keep me
company?"</p>
<p>He looked at the smiling lips, the serious, searching eyes, and
he spoke his thoughts impulsively.</p>
<p>"I shall be the most honored man in Paris!"</p>
<p>"That is well! Then we will talk, and watch the stars."</p>
<p>Here the na&iuml;ve imperiousness of the boy gleamed out,
familiar and reassuring, and Maxine walked across the room, turning
at the window to look back for Blake.</p>
<p>"He is not without appreciation&mdash;this little brother of
mine?" She put the question softly, tentatively, as she and Blake
leaned over the balcony railing.</p>
<p>"He is an artist, princess."</p>
<p>"You think so?" Her voice warmed and vibrated; through the vague
darkness he felt her eyes search his face.</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly."</p>
<p>"Ah, you love him?" The voice dropped to a great
gentleness&mdash;a gentleness that touched him in a strange
degree.</p>
<p>"It would be difficult to tell you what he has been to me," he
said. "Our friendship has been a thing of great value. Has he ever
told you how we met?"</p>
<p>"He has told me!" Her tone was still low&mdash;still curiously
attractive. "And he appreciates very highly, monsieur, the
affection you have given him."</p>
<p>She paused; and Blake, looking down upon Paris, was conscious of
that pause as of something pregnant and miraculous. It filled the
moment, combining, with the soft texture of her garments and the
faint scent from her hair, to weave a spell subtle as it was
intangible.</p>
<p>"There is nothing to appreciate," he made answer. "I am merely a
commonplace mortal who found in him something uncommon. The
appreciation is mine entirely&mdash;the appreciation of the youth,
the vitality he expresses."</p>
<p>"Ah, but you do yourself an injustice!" She spoke impulsively
and, as if alarmed at her own eagerness, broke off and began anew
in a soberer voice. "I mean, monsieur, that friendship is not a
solitary affair. Whatever you discerned in Max, Max must equally
have discerned in you."</p>
<p>"I wonder!" He turned his gaze from the lights of the city to
the rustling trees of the plantation. The hour was magical, the
situation beyond belief. Standing there upon the balcony, suspended
as it were between heaven and earth, companioned by this wonderful,
familiar, unfamiliar being, he seemed to see his own soul&mdash;to
see it from afar off and with a great lucidity. "I wonder!" he said
again; and the sadness, the discontent that stalked him in lonely
moments touched him briefly, like the shadow of a travelling
cloud.</p>
<p>"What do you wonder, monsieur?"</p>
<p>"The meaning of it all, princess! Existence is such a chase. I,
perhaps, hunt friendship&mdash;and find Max; I, perhaps, dream that
I have found my goal, while to him I may be but a wayside
inn&mdash;a place to linger in and leave! We both follow the chase,
but who can say if we mark the same quarry? It's a puzzling
world!"</p>
<p>"Monsieur, it is sometimes a glorious world!" So swift was her
change of voice, so impulsive the gesture with which she turned to
him, that the vividness of a suggested Max startled him. She was
infinitely like to Max&mdash;Max when life intoxicated him, when he
threw out both arms to embrace it.</p>
<p>"When you look like that, princess," he cried, "I could forget
everything&mdash;I could take your hand, and show you all my heart,
for you literally <i>are</i> the boy!"</p>
<p>There was another pause&mdash;a pause fraught with poignant
things. Standing there, between heaven and earth, they were no
longer creatures of conventionality, fettered by individual worlds.
They were two souls conscious of an affinity.</p>
<p>Briefly, sweetly, Maxine's fingers touched his hand and then
withdrew. "Monsieur, in moments I <i>am</i> Max!"</p>
<p>Nothing of surprise, nothing of question came to him. He only
knew that a touch, infinitely desired, had lighted upon
him&mdash;that a comprehension born of immaterial things was luring
him whither he knew not.</p>
<p>"You are Max, princess," he said, swiftly, "but Max suddenly
made possessor of a soul! I've always fancied Max a mythical
being&mdash;a creature of eternal youth, fascinating as he is
elusive&mdash;a faun-like creature, peeping into the world from
some secret grove, ready to dart back at any human touch. Max's
lips were made for laughter; his eyes are too bright for
tears."</p>
<p>"And I, monsieur? What am I?"</p>
<p>"You are the miracle! You are the elusive creature deserting the
green groves&mdash;stepping voluntarily into the mortal world."</p>
<p>"Yet if you know of me at all, you must know that I have left
the mortal world and am seeking the secret groves."</p>
<p>"I have been told that."</p>
<p>"And you disbelieve?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid, princess, I do." He turned and looked at
her&mdash;at the slim body wrapped in its long, smooth cloak of
velvet&mdash;at the shadowed, questioning eyes. "I know I am
greatly daring, but there are moments when we are outside
ourselves&mdash;when we know and speak things of which we can give
no logical account. You have put life behind you; yet what is life
but a will-o'-the-wisp? Who can say where the light may not break
forth again?"</p>
<p>"But have we not power over our senses, monsieur? Can we not
shut our eyes, even if the light does break forth?"</p>
<p>"No, princess, we cannot! Because nature will inevitably say, 'I
have given you eyes with which to see. Open those eyes'!"</p>
<p>"Ah, there we differ, monsieur!"</p>
<p>Blake laughed. "There, princess, you are the boy! He, too,
thinks he can cheat nature; but I preach my gospel to him, I tell
him Nature will have her own. If we will not bend to her, she will
take and break us. Ah, but listen to that!"</p>
<p>His discourse broke off; they both involuntarily raised their
heads and looked toward the windows of the neighboring
<i>appartement</i>.</p>
<p>"Princess!" he said, delightedly. "I wouldn't have had you miss
this for ten thousand pounds! Has Max described his neighbor, M.
Cartel? I tell you you will have a little of heaven when M. Cartel
plays <i>Louise</i>!"</p>
<p>Very delicately, with a curious human clarity of sound, the
violin of M. Cartel executed the first notes of Louise's
declaration in the duet with Julian&mdash;'<i>Depuis le jour
o&ugrave; je me suis donn&eacute;e!'</i> One caught the whole
intention of the composer in the few crystal notes&mdash;one
figured the whole scene&mdash;the little house of love, the lovers
in their Garden of Eden, and below Paris&mdash;symbolic Paris!</p>
<p>"You know <i>Louise</i>, princess?"</p>
<p>"Yes, monsieur, I know <i>Louise</i>."</p>
<p>All was clear, all was understood in that brief reply. A wide
contentment, vitalized by excitement, lifted the soul of Blake.
Leaning over the balcony railing, drinking in the music of M.
Cartel, more than a little of heaven opened to him; a unique
emotion thrilled him&mdash;a consciousness of sublimity, a sense of
being part of some unfathomable yet perfect scheme. The music wove
its story; the lovers became one with his own existence, as he
himself was one with the stars above him and the lights below. He
followed every note, and in his own brain was spun the subtle
thread that bound Julian and Louise; his own fancy ran the gamut of
their emotions from mere human reminiscence to overwhelming
passion.</p>
<p>As he listened, his first hearing of M. Cartel's fiddle crept
back upon the feet of memory, and with it the recollection of the
boy's rapture, the boy's wayward breaking of the spell and denial
of the truth of love. Cautiously he moved his head and stole a
glance at his companion, summing up the contrast between the
present and the past.</p>
<p>Maxine was leaning forward, in thrall to the music: her gray
cloak had fallen slightly back, displaying her white
dress&mdash;her white neck; her hands were clasped, her
eyes&mdash;the woman's eyes, the eyes of mystery&mdash;gazed into
profound space.</p>
<p>He held himself rigid; he dared not stir, lest he should brush
her cloak; he scarce dared breathe, lest he should break her dream.
A feeling akin to adoration awakened in him, and as if in
expression of the emotion, the violin of M. Cartel cried out the
supreme confession of the lovers, Louise's enraptured '<i>C'est le
Paradis! C'est une f&eacute;erie</i>!', and Julian's answer,
intoxicating as wine, '<i>Non! C'est la vie! l'Eternelle, la
toute-puissante vie</i>!'</p>
<p>And there, with the whimsicality of the artist, the bow of M.
Cartel was lifted, and sharp, pregnant silence fell upon the
night.</p>
<p>Blake turned to Maxine; and Maxine, with lips parted, eyes dark
with thought, met his regard.</p>
<p>For one second her impulse seemed to sway to words, her body to
yield to some gracious, drooping enchantment; then, swiftly as M.
Cartel had called up silence, she recalled
herself&mdash;straightened her body and lifted her head.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," she said, with dignity, "I thank you for your
kindness and for your companionship&mdash;and I bid you
good-night!"</p>
<p>The swiftness of his dismissal scarcely touched Blake. Already
she was his sovereign lady&mdash;her look a command, her word
paramount.</p>
<p>"As you will, princess!"</p>
<p>She held out her hand; and taking, he bowed over, but did not
kiss it.</p>
<p>She smiled, conceiving his desire and his restraint.</p>
<p>"I shall convey to Max how charmingly you have entertained me,
monsieur and, perhaps&mdash;" Her voice dropped to its softest
note.</p>
<p>Blake looked up.</p>
<p>"Perhaps, princess&mdash;?"</p>
<p>She smiled again, half diffidently. "Nothing, monsieur!
Good-night!"</p>
<p>"Good-night!"</p>
<p>He left her to the gray mystery of the stars, and passed back
through the quiet, lamp-lit room and down the slippery stairs that
led to the mundane world; and with each step he took, each breath
he drew, the words from <i>Louise</i> repeated themselves,
justifying all things, glorifying all things: '<i>C'est la vie!
l'Eternelle, la toute-puissante vie</i>!'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">BLAKE must have reached the last step of the
Escalier de Sainte-Marie, must indeed have turned the corner of the
rue Andr&eacute; de Sarte before the creaking of a footstep or the
opening of a door disturbed the silence of the fifth floor; but,
due time having expired&mdash;due deference having been paid to
taste and the proprieties&mdash;the handle of M. Cartel's door was
very softly turned, and Jacqueline slipped forth into the shadowed
landing.</div>
<p>Never were human curiosity and feminine craft more signally
displayed than in the slim little form creeping on tiptoe, the
astute, <i>piquante</i> little face thrust forth into the dark.
Across the landing she stole, and with deft fingers opened Max's
door without a sound.</p>
<p>Here, in the narrow hallway, she paused and called gently,
"Monsieur Max!" But as no voice answered, she crept to the
<i>salon</i> door and, with a little comedy of smiles all for her
own diversion, called again with pursed lips and in a stage
whisper: "Madame! Madame!"</p>
<p>It carried&mdash;this portentous word&mdash;across the quiet
room to the balcony where Maxine was lingering; it drew from her a
little 'oh,' of consternation; finally, it brought her running
across the room to her visitor.</p>
<p>Jacqueline, lynx-eyed, stood and looked at her&mdash;noting how
flushed she was, how youthful-looking, how unguarded and brimming
with emotion.</p>
<p>"Madame!" she cried. "I know without a word! It has been a grand
success."</p>
<a name="eternal"></a>
<center><img src="images/ill226.jpg" width="400" height="614" alt=
"&quot;&lt;i&gt;C'EST LA VIE! L'ETERNELLE, LA TOUTE-PUISSANTE VIE!&lt;/i&gt;&quot;">
</center>
<h5>"C'EST LA VIE! L'ETERNELLE, LA TOUTE-PUISSANTE VIE!"</h5>
<p>Maxine laughed, a girlish laugh of self-betrayal. "A grand
success! Absolutely a grand success! And, Jacqueline"&mdash;she
hesitated, laughed again with charming self-consciousness, rushed
afresh into speech&mdash;"Jacqueline, he thought me beautiful! Not
a word was said, but I know he thought me beautiful. Tell me! Am I
beautiful?" Swiftly, as might the boy, she threw off her velvet
cloak, letting it fall to the ground, and showed herself tall and
supple and straight in her white dress.</p>
<p>Jacqueline rushed forward warmly, caught and kissed her
hand.</p>
<p>"Madame, you are ravishing!" And, with her pretty native
practicality, she picked up the cloak, carefully folded and
carefully laid it aside.</p>
<p>"Ravishing!" Maxine laughed once more. "Jacqueline, I am
something more than that! I am happy!" She threw out her arms, as
if to embrace the universe. "I am happier than the saints in
heaven! I am living in the moment, and the moment is perfection! I
care nothing that yesterday I wept, that to-morrow I may weep
again. I am alive and I am happy. I feel as I used to feel at
fifteen years old, galloping a spirited horse. The whole world is
sublime&mdash;from the dust in the streets to the stars in the
sky!" She forgot her companion, her speech broke off, she turned
and began to pace the room with head thrown back, hands clasped
behind her with careless, boyish ease.</p>
<p>For a while Jacqueline watched her, diligently sifting out every
emotional sign; then, deeming that some moment of her own choosing
had arrived, she slipped unobserved from the room, to return a
minute later bearing a kettle full of boiling water.</p>
<p>Maxine looked round as she made her entry.</p>
<p>"A kettle, Jacqueline?"</p>
<p>"For madame's tea. And, my God, but it is hot!" She set it down
hastily in the fireplace, and sucked her finger with a pouting
smile.</p>
<p>Maxine smiled, too, coming back from her dream with vague
graciousness. "But I do not need tea."</p>
<p>Jacqueline did not refute the statement, but merely began to
manipulate the <i>samovar</i> in the manner learned of Max, while
Maxine, yielding to her own delicious exaltation, fell again to her
long, slow pacing of the floor.</p>
<p>Presently the inviting smell of tea began to pervade the room,
and Jacqueline set out a cup and saucer&mdash;Max's first purchase
from old Bluebeard of the curios.</p>
<p>"Madame is served!" She stood behind the chair ordained for
Maxine, very sedate, very assured of her own arrangements.</p>
<p>Maxine paused, as though the suggestion of tea was brought to
her for the first time.</p>
<p>"How delightful!" she said, with swift, serene pleasure. "How
kind! How thoughtful!"</p>
<p>"Seat yourself, madame!"</p>
<p>The chair was drawn forward; the just and proper thrill of
preparation was conveyed by Jacqueline; and Maxine seated herself,
still in her smiling dream.</p>
<p>Half the cup of tea was consumed under Jacqueline's watchful
eye, then she stole round the chair.</p>
<p>"Madame, a cigarette?" Her fingers crept to the cigarette-box,
then found and struck a match, all with a deft, unobtrusive quiet
that won its way undenied.</p>
<p>The cigarette was lighted, Maxine leaned back in her chair,
Jacqueline's confidential moment was secured.</p>
<p>"And so, madame, it was a grand success?"</p>
<p>Maxine looked up. The first fine ecstasy was past; the
after-glow of deep contentment curled round her with the cigarette
smoke; she was the pliant reed to the soft wind of Jacqueline's
whispering.</p>
<p>"It was past belief," she answered, "past all belief. We stood
together in the light of the lamp and looked each other in the
eyes, and he never guessed. He never guessed&mdash;he, who
has&mdash;Oh, it was past belief!"</p>
<p>"Ah!" murmured Jacqueline, complacently. "I told madame I had a
quite extraordinary talent in the dressing of hair&mdash;though
madame was sceptical! And as for the purchase of clothes. Did he
admire madame's velvet cloak?"</p>
<p>Maxine smiled tolerantly. "Of course he did not!"</p>
<p>Jacqueline cast up her eyes to heaven. "These English&mdash;they
are extraordinary! But I tell you this, madame, he knew
here"&mdash;she touched her heart&mdash;"he knew here, that madame
looked what she is&mdash;a queen!"</p>
<p>"Absurd child!"</p>
<p>The reproof was gentle; Jacqueline's nimble tongue took
advantage of the chance given it.</p>
<p>"And tell me, madame? He play his part gallantly&mdash;Monsieur
&Eacute;douard?" Never before had she dared so much; but never
before had Maxine's eyes looked as they looked to-night.</p>
<p>Before replying, Maxine leaned her elbows on the table and took
her face between her hands.</p>
<p>"It was past belief&mdash;that also!" she said at last. "He
seemed a different being. I cannot understand it."</p>
<p>"He seemed of a greater interest, madame?"</p>
<p>"Of a strangely greater interest."</p>
<p>"In what manner, madame? Looks? Words?" Cunning as a monkey,
little Jacqueline was all soft innocence in the method of her
questioning.</p>
<p>"In every way&mdash;manner&mdash;speech&mdash;expression of
thought. And, Jacqueline"&mdash;she turned her face, all radiant
and unsuspicious, to her interlocutor&mdash;"I made a discovery! He
loves Max!"</p>
<p>Jacqueline, with downcast eyes and discreet bearing, carefully
removed the empty tea-cup.</p>
<p>"Yes, he loves me as Max! He told me so. It has made me
marvellously happy&mdash;marvellously happy and, also"&mdash;she
sighed&mdash;"also, Jacqueline, just a little sad!"</p>
<p>"Sad, madame?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sad because he loves Max as one loves a child, expecting
no return; and&mdash;I would be loved as an equal."</p>
<p>"Assuredly, madame."</p>
<p>"I <i>must</i> be loved as an equal!" Fire suddenly kindled her
dreaming voice; a look, clear and alert, suddenly crossed her eyes.
"Jacqueline," she cried, "I have set myself a new task. I shall
make him respect Max as well as love him; Max shall become his
equal. Now, suppose you set yourself a task like that, how would
you begin?"</p>
<p>"Oh, madame!" Jacqueline was all deprecation.</p>
<p>"Do not fear. Tell me!"</p>
<p>"Madame, it is not for me&mdash;" Jacqueline's triumph in the
moment, and her concealing of the triumph, were things exquisitely
feminine.</p>
<p>"Tell me!"</p>
<p>"I may speak from the heart, madame?"</p>
<p>Maxine bent her head in gracious condescension.</p>
<p>"Then, madame, I would make of Monsieur &Eacute;douard a book of
figures. The princess would learn the rules; Monsieur Max would
shut the book, and make up the sum. It would be quite simple."</p>
<p>The hot color scorched Maxine's face; she rose quickly.
"Jacqueline! I had not expected this!"</p>
<p>"Madame desired me to speak from the heart. The heart, at times,
is unruly!"</p>
<p>"True! Forgive me. But you should not suggest a thing that you
know to be impossible."</p>
<p>"Pardon, madame! I was thinking of the many impossibilities
performed in a good cause!"</p>
<p>"Say no more, Jacqueline! To-night was to-night! To-night is
over!" She walked across the room and passed out upon the balcony,
leaning over the railing at the spot where Blake had stood.</p>
<p>Jacqueline, swift and guileful, was instantly beside her.</p>
<p>"Madame, at its most serious, to-night was a little comedy. Is
it so criminal to repeat a little comedy&mdash;once, or even
twice&mdash;in a good cause? It is not as if madame were not sure
of herself! Besides, the comedy was charming!"</p>
<p>"Yes; the comedy was charming!" Maxine echoed the sentiment, and
in her heart called 'charming' a poor word. "But even if I were
weak, Jacqueline," she added, "how could I banish Max? Max could
scarcely continue to have important business."</p>
<p>"Perhaps not, madame; but Monsieur Max might continue to display
temper! Do not forget that he and Monsieur &Eacute;douard did not
part upon the friendliest terms."</p>
<p>Maxine smiled.</p>
<p>"But even granted that, I could not be here
again&mdash;alone."</p>
<p>Jacqueline, with airiest scorn, tossed the words aside.</p>
<p>"That, madame? Why, that arranges itself! The princess loves her
brother! His quarrel is her grief. Is not woman always
compassionate?"</p>
<p>The tone was irresistible. Maxine laughed. "Jacqueline, you were
the Serpent in Adam's Garden! There is not a doubt of it! No wonder
poor M. Cartel has taken so big a bite of the Apple."</p>
<p>She laughed again, and Jacqueline laughed too, in mischievous
delight.</p>
<p>"Madame!" she coaxed. "Madame!"</p>
<p>"No!" said Maxine, with eyes fixed determinately upon the lights
of the city; while somewhere above her in the cool, clear
starlight, a hidden voice&mdash;her own, and not her
own&mdash;whispered a subtle 'Yes!'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">THE universe is compounded of the miraculous;
but love is the miracle of miracles. Again the impossible had been
contrived; again Maxine and Blake were standing together on the
balcony. The Parisian night seemed as still as a held breath, and
as palpitating with human possibilities; the domes of the
Sacr&eacute;-Coeur loomed white against the sky, dumb witnesses to
the existence of the spirit. The scene was undoubtedly poetic; yet,
placed in the noisiest highway of London or the most desolate
bog-land of Blake's native country, these two would have been as
truly and amply cognizant of the real and the ideal; for the cloak
of love was about them, the vapor of love was before their eyes,
and for the hour, although they knew it not, they were capable of
reconstructing a whole world from the material in their own
hearts.</div>
<p>But they were divinely ignorant; they each tricked themselves
with the age-old fallacy of a unique position, each wandered onward
in the dream-like fields of romance, content to believe that the
other knew the hidden way.</p>
<p>The scene bore a perfect similarity to the scene of the first
meeting&mdash;about them, the darkness and the quiet&mdash;behind
them, the little <i>salon</i> lit by the familiar lamp, showing all
the reassuring evidences of the boy's occupation. For close upon an
hour they had enjoyed this intimacy of the balcony, at first
talking much and rapidly upon the ostensible object of their
meeting&mdash;Max's quarrel with Blake, later falling to a happy
silence, as though they deliberately closed their lips, the more
fully to drink in the secrets of the night through eyes and ears.
Strange spells were in the weaving, and no two souls are fused to
harmony without much subtle questioning of spirit, many delicate,
tremulous speculations compounded of wordless joy and wordless
fear.</p>
<p>Some issue, it was, in this matter of fusing personalities, that
at last caused Maxine to turn her head and find Blake studying
her.</p>
<p>The circumstance was trivial&mdash;a mere crossing of glances,
but it brought the color to her face as swiftly as if she had been
taken in some guilty act.</p>
<p>Blake saw the expression, and interpreted it wrongly.</p>
<p>"You are displeased, princess? I am a bad companion to-night?"
He spoke impulsively, with an anxiety in his voice that spurred her
to a desire to comfort him.</p>
<p>"When people are sympathetic, monsieur, they are companions,
whether good or bad. Is it not so?"</p>
<p>He moved a little nearer to her; neither was aware of the
movement.</p>
<p>"Do you find me sympathetic?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, yes!" Her luminous glance rested on him
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"But you scarcely know me."</p>
<p>"Monsieur, I do know you."</p>
<p>"Through the boy, perhaps&mdash;" He spoke with a touch of
impatience, but she stopped him with upraised hand.</p>
<p>"You are angry with Max, therefore you must be silent! Anger
does not make for true judgment."</p>
<p>"Ah, that's unfair!" He laughed. "'Tis Max who is angry with me!
You know I came here to-night with open arms&mdash;to find him
flown! Still, I am willing to keep them open, and give the kiss of
peace whenever he relents&mdash;to please you."</p>
<p>"Ah, no, monsieur! To please him. To please him."</p>
<p>"Indeed, no! To please you&mdash;and no one else. If I followed
my own devices, I'd wait till he comes back, and box his ears. He'd
very well deserve it."</p>
<p>Maxine laughed; then, swift as a breeze or a racing cloud, her
mood changed.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, you care for Max?"</p>
<p>"What a question! I love Max. He's a star in my
darkness&mdash;or was, until the sun shone."</p>
<p>He paused, fearful of where his impulses had led him; but Maxine
was all sweetness, all seriousness.</p>
<p>"Am I, then, the sun, monsieur?"</p>
<p>In any other woman the words must have seemed a lure; but here
was a fairness, a frankness and dignity that lifted the question to
another and higher plane. Blake, comprehending, answered simply
with the truth.</p>
<p>"Yes, you are the sun; and all my life I have been a
sun-worshipper."</p>
<p>She made no comment; she accepted the words, waiting for the
flow of speech that she knew was close at hand&mdash;the speech,
probably irrelevant, certainly delightful, that he invariably
poured forth at such a moment.</p>
<p>"Princess, do you know my country?"</p>
<p>She shook her head, smiling a little.</p>
<p>"Ah, then you don't understand my worship! In Ireland, nature
condemns us to a long, black, wet winter and a long, gray, wet
spring, so that the heart of a man is nearly drowned in his body,
and he grows to believe that his country is nothing but a
neutral-tinted waste; but one day, when even hope is dying, a
miracle comes to pass&mdash;the sun shines out! The sun shines out,
and he suddenly sees that his waste land is the color of emeralds
and that his dripping woods are gardens, tinted like no stones that
jewellers ever handle. Oh, no wonder I am a sun-worshipper!"</p>
<p>Maxine, glowing to his sudden enthusiasm, clasped her hands, as
when she heard the music of M. Cartel.</p>
<p>"Ah, and that is your country?"</p>
<p>"That is my country, princess."</p>
<p>"I wish&mdash;&mdash;" She stopped.</p>
<p>"That you could see it?"</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"And why not? Why not&mdash;when this boy sees reason? How I
would love to show it to you! You would understand."</p>
<p>"When would you show it to me?" She spoke very low.</p>
<p>"When? Oh, perhaps in April&mdash;April, when the washed skies
are a blue that even Max could not find in his color-box, and the
bare boughs tremble with promise. In April&mdash;or, better still,
in the autumn. In October, when the lights are cool and white and
the sea is an opal; when you smell the ozone strong as violets, and
at every turn of the road a cart confronts you, heaped with bronze
seaweed and stuck with a couple of pikes that rise stark against
the sky-line, to suggest the taking of the spoils. Yes, in October!
In October, it should be!"</p>
<p>He was carried away, and she loved him for his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"You care for your country?" she said, very softly.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;in an odd way! When wonder or joy or ambition comes
to me, I always have a craving to walk those roads and watch the
sea and whisper my secrets to the salt earth, but I never gratify
the desire; it belongs to the many incongruities of an incongruous
nature. But I think if great happiness came to me, I should go
back, if only for a day; or if&mdash;" He paused. "&mdash;If I were
to break my heart over anything, I believe I'd creep back, like a
child to its mother. We're odd creatures&mdash;we Irish!"</p>
<p>"I understand you," said Maxine. "You have the soul."</p>
<p>He looked down into the rue M&uuml;ller, and a queer smile
touched his lips.</p>
<p>"A questionable blessing one is apt to say, princess&mdash;in
one's bad moments!"</p>
<p>"But only in one's bad moments!" Her tone was warm; her words
came from her swiftly, after the manner of Max&mdash;the manner
that Blake loved.</p>
<p>"You are quite right!" he said, "and I despise myself instantly
I have uttered such a cynicism. The capacity to feel is worth all
the pain it brings. If one had but a single moment of realization,
one should die content. That is the essential&mdash;to have known
the highest."</p>
<p>Once again Maxine had the sense of lifting a tangible veil, of
gaining a glimpse of the hidden personality&mdash;not the
half-sceptical, pleasant, friendly Blake of the boy's acquaintance,
but Blake the dreamer, the idealist who sought some grail of
infinite holiness figured in his own imagination, zealously guarded
from the scoffer and the worldling. A swift desire pulsed in her to
share the knowledge of this quest&mdash;to see the face of the
knight illumined for his adventure&mdash;to touch the buckles of
his armor.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," she whispered, "if you were to die to-night, would
you die satisfied?"</p>
<p>In the silence that had fallen upon them, Blake had turned his
face to the stars, but now again his glance sought hers.</p>
<p>"No, princess," he said, simply.</p>
<p>No weapons are more potent than brevity and simplicity. His
answer brought the blood to her face as no long dissertation could
have brought it; it was so direct, so personal, so compounded of
subtle values.</p>
<p>"Then you have not known the highest?" It was not she who framed
the question; some power outside herself constrained her to its
speaking.</p>
<p>"I have recognized perfection," he said, "but I have not known
it. And sometimes my weaker self&mdash;the primitive, barbaric
self&mdash;cries out against the limitation; sometimes&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Sometimes&mdash;?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, princess&mdash;and everything!" With a sudden wave of
self-control he brought himself back to the moment and its
responsibilities. "Forgive me! And, if you are merciful, dismiss
me! They say we Irish talk too much. I am afraid I am a true
Irishman." He laughed, but there was a sound behind the laughter
that brought tears to her eyes.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, it has been happy to-night?"</p>
<p>"It has been heaven."</p>
<p>"We are not wholly a trouble to you&mdash;Max and I?"</p>
<p>She put out her hand, and he took it.</p>
<p>"Max is my friend, princess; you are my sovereign lady."</p>
<p>The night was close about them; Paris was below, gilding the
rose of human love; the church domes were above, tending whitely
toward the stars. Maxine moved nearer to him, her heart beating
fast, her whole radiant being dispensing fragrance.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, if I am your lady, pay me homage!"</p>
<p>The enchantment was delicate and perfect; her voice wove a
spell, her slight, strong fingers trembled in his. He had been less
than man had he refused the moment. Silently he bent his head, and
his lips touched her hand in a swift, ardent kiss.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">MAXINE was in high exaltation&mdash;the
exaltation that makes no count of cost. Yesterday mattered not at
all; to-morrow might never dawn! As the outer door closed upon
Blake, she turned back into the lighted <i>salon</i>&mdash;the
little <i>salon</i> of Max's books, of Max's boyish
tastes&mdash;the little <i>salon</i> loved beyond all rooms in
Paris!</div>
<p>In a smiling dream she passed through it, on into the studio
where no light was, save the light from a shred of crescent moon
that had lately climbed into the sky. It had a curious
effect&mdash;this bare, white room with its gaunt easel, upon which
the portrait still stood, and to superstitious eyes, it might well
have suggested a ghost-chamber, peopled by dead thoughts, dead
impressions: but Maxine was in no morbid mood, happiness ran too
high&mdash;too red and warm&mdash;to permit of shadows disputing
its high place.</p>
<p>Smiling, smiling, she passed from the studio to the bedroom. The
room that had witnessed her first weakness; the room that had
brought her strength. How infinitely wise had been the conduct of
that night! How irrevocably fate had created doubt and dispersed it
by inspiration. If she had not twisted her hair about her
head&mdash;if the little Jacqueline had not entered at the critical
moment&mdash;if, for that matter, M. Cartel and his friend had not
talked late and partaken of <i>bouillon</i>&mdash;</p>
<p>She laughed; she wandered round the room, touching, appraising
the little familiar trifles associated with that past hour; at last
she sat down before her mirror, and there Jacqueline found her ten
minutes later, when curiosity could no longer be withheld and she
came creeping across the landing for news of the night's
doings.</p>
<p>Maxine heard her enter; heard her search the <i>salon</i> and
then the studio; finally called to her.</p>
<p>"Jacqueline!"</p>
<p>"Madame!"</p>
<p>The door opened, and Maxine looked round, the smile still upon
her lips.</p>
<p>"No soup for me to-night, Jacqueline? Not even tea?"</p>
<p>Jacqueline caught the happy lightness of the tone, and silently
nodded her blonde head as she tiptoed into the room.</p>
<p>"Ah, madame has had a banquet of the mind! Madame has no need of
my poor food."</p>
<p>Maxine picked up a comb and arranged the tendrils of hair that
curled about her temples.</p>
<p>"Jacqueline," she said, after a silence, "what do you consider
the highest thing?"</p>
<p>The question might have been astonishing, but her visitor did
not betray surprise by even the quiver of an eyelash.</p>
<p>"Love, madame," she said.</p>
<p>And Maxine did not flash round upon her in one of her swift
rages, did not even draw her brows together into their frowning
line. She merely gazed into the mirror, as if weighing the
statement judicially.</p>
<p>"All people do not hold that opinion," she said, at last.</p>
<p>Jacqueline shrugged her shoulders in the exercise of an infinite
patience. "No, madame?"</p>
<p>"No. M. Blake talked to-night of 'the highest thing,' and he did
not mean love."</p>
<p>"No, madame?" Jacqueline was very guileless.</p>
<p>But guileless as her tone was&mdash;nay, by reason of its
guilelessness&mdash;it touched Maxine in some shadowy corner of her
woman's consciousness; and spurred by a subtle, disquieting
suggestion, she turned in her chair, and fixed her serious gray
eyes upon her visitor.</p>
<p>"What are your thoughts, Jacqueline?"</p>
<p>Jacqueline, taken unawares, deprecated.</p>
<p>"Oh, madame&mdash;"</p>
<p>But Maxine was set to her point. "Answer my question," she
insisted. "I wish to know. I am, above all things, practical."</p>
<p>It was to Jacqueline's credit that she did not smile, that she
simply murmured: "Who doubts it, madame?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I am, above all things, practical. In this affair of the
woman, I know exactly where I stand."</p>
<p>The girl made no comment; but even to Maxine's own ears, her
declaration left a little suggestion of over-vehemence vibrating in
the air; and startled by this suggestion, she did the least wise,
the most human thing possible, she accentuated it.</p>
<p>"If I were different&mdash;if M. Blake were different, I grant
that, perhaps&mdash;" She stopped abruptly. "Jacqueline, what are
your thoughts?"</p>
<p>"Oh, madame, I have none!"</p>
<p>And here Maxine made a change of front, became very grave,
touched the gracious, encouraging note of the being to whom life is
an open book.</p>
<p>"You must not say that," she corrected, sweetly. "You always
have ideas&mdash;even if they are sometimes a little in the air.
Come! Tell me. What are your thoughts?"</p>
<p>But Jacqueline was wary, as befitted one who made no pretence of
scholarship, but who knew the old human story by heart, and daily
recited it to one ardent listener.</p>
<p>"Oh, madame, it is not fitting&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Absurd! Tell me."</p>
<p>Jacqueline, hard pressed, sought refuge in a truth.</p>
<p>"My thoughts might displease madame."</p>
<p>Maxine sat straighter in her chair. Here was another matter!</p>
<p>"Ah, so that is it! Well, now I am determined. Now I will have
the thoughts at any cost."</p>
<p>When Maxine spoke like this, when her lips closed upon her
words, when her eyes rested unflinchingly upon her listener, she
was wont to have her questions answered. Jacqueline recognized the
moment, saw Maxine in all her proud foolishness, loved her with
that swift intermingling of pity and worship that such beings as
she inevitably call forth, finally tossed her little head in her
most tantalizing manner and laughed.</p>
<p>"With madame's permission," she said, "I will wish her
good-night!"</p>
<p>"The permission is not granted."</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, madame!" Her hand was on the door.</p>
<p>"Wait!" cried Maxine, peremptorily. "I have asked you a question
and you must answer it."</p>
<p>Jacqueline stopped half-way through the doorway, and looked
back, her flower-like face alight with mischief.</p>
<p>"Pardon, madame! 'Must' is the word for the ruler. Lucien says
'must' to me; M. Blake says 'must' to"&mdash;she paused, with
maddening precision; she dropped a little impertinent
curtsy&mdash;"to M. Max!"</p>
<p>She tossed the word upon the air, as a child might blow
thistle-down; she laughed and was gone, leaving Maxine conscious of
a strange new sensation that whipped her to anger and yet, most
curiously, left her bereft of words.</p>
<hr style='width: 65%;'>
<br>
<br>
<a name='CHAPTER_XXXI'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">NOTHING less than absolute conviction can shake
a strong nature. A wave of doubt swept over Maxine as her little
neighbor's words died out and the door closed, leaving her to
silence and solitude; but for all her folly, she was strong, and
strength such as hers is not shaken by the shaft of a Jacqueline,
however cunningly sped.</div>
<p>She sat for long, troubled, perplexed&mdash;almost, it might
have seemed, fearful of herself&mdash;- but gradually the strength
asserted itself, the fine, blind faith within her asserted itself
in a wave of reaction.</p>
<p>Some small weakness had been hers, she admitted&mdash;some small
shrinking from the truth of things! She had been remiss in the
application of her test, allowing the dream to oust the reality in
that fascinating hour with Blake. Remiss, but no more!</p>
<p>At this stage in her meditations, she returned to the balcony,
studying the sky anew&mdash;drinking in confidence from the glory
of the stars, the slight grace of the crescent moon.</p>
<p>She became the boy again in mind and heart, enthusiastic,
assured, thirsting for action; she looked down upon Paris frankly
and without defiance&mdash;or so she deemed; and the old, wild
suggestions of 'liberty, equality, brotherhood,' seemed to rise,
ghostly, from its stones.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm is ever a gracious, pardonable thing, because in its
essentials are youth and zeal and all high, white-hot qualities
whose roots strike not in the base earth. Any sage, nay, any
simpleton, seeing Maxine upon the balcony, could have told her what
a fool she was; but who would have told it without a pause, without
a sigh for the divinity of such folly?</p>
<p>Next day she rose, refreshed of body, because refreshed of soul;
and arrayed in the garments of her strength, went forth to prove
her faith.</p>
<p>Max it was&mdash;Max of the quick, lithe feet and eager
glance&mdash;who left the rue M&uuml;ller, heedless of breakfast,
and began his descent upon Paris, making straight for the heart of
the citadel with the true instinct of the raider.</p>
<p>Up to this moment, Blake's rooms had been a mere name, lying as
they did within the forbidden precincts of the fashionable world,
but to-day no corner of Paris offered terrors, for the simple
reason that Paris itself had come to be incorporated in Blake, and
that, being strong enough to dare Blake, Max was strong enough to
dare the city.</p>
<p>Self-analysis played no part in his mental process as he swung
down the steep, familiar streets. A singleness of purpose, high as
it was foolish, possessed and inspired him. He loved Blake with a
wonderful, unsexual love, and he yearned to lay himself at his
feet, to offer him of his best&mdash;gifts of the gods, given with
free hands from a free heart.</p>
<p>Something of the sweet foolishness must have shown upon his
face, for when he reached his destination, Blake's
<i>concierge</i>, usually a taciturn individual, offered him a
welcome as he stepped from the brilliant sunshine into the dim cool
hallway, and gave him the information he needed with a good
grace.</p>
<p>So far, well! But happy assurance emanated from him, and success
is compounded of such assurance. He knocked upon Blake's door,
certain that Blake himself and not his servant would answer to his
summons; and as though the gods smiled at the childish confidence,
his certainty was rewarded. The sound of a familiar step set his
pulses racing, a hand was laid upon the door, and desire became
accomplished.</p>
<p>"What! Max?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Max! Is he welcome?" All the hoarded strength of the night
was audible in the words. Max threw up his head, met Blake's eyes,
held out his hand&mdash;the boy in every particular.</p>
<p>"Welcome? As welcome as the flowers in May! Come in! Come along
in!" Blake had accepted the masquerade; all was as before.</p>
<p>Together they passed into the <i>salon</i>, and instantly Blake
became host&mdash;the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of <i>r&ocirc;les</i> for
him.</p>
<p>"Now, boy, don't tell me you have breakfasted! But even if you
have, you must breakfast again. Come, sit down! Sit down! My fellow
makes most excellent coffee&mdash;good as Madame Gustav's of the
rue Fabert! Remember the rue Fabert?"</p>
<p>So he rattled on, placing a second chair, seeking an additional
cup, and ever Max listened, happy with an acute happiness that
almost touched the verge of tears.</p>
<p>But though emotion choked him he played his part gallantly. He
was the boy of old days to the very life, swaggering a little in a
youthful forgivable conceit, playing the lord of creation to an
amused, sympathetic audience.</p>
<p>"Ned," he cried at last, flinging his words from him with all
the old frank ease, "tell me to apologize!"</p>
<p>Blake looked up, and the affection, the tolerance in the look
quivered through Max's senses.</p>
<p>"Now, boy! Now!" he warned. "Be careful what you're saying! It's
only very ordinary friends talk about apologies. And I don't think
we have ever been very ordinary friends."</p>
<p>"No! No! But still&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, say your say!"</p>
<p>The tone was full of indulgence, but, also, it was touched with
subtler things. This unexpected invasion had pleased and flattered
Blake; it spoke an influence used on his behalf that he dared not
have claimed&mdash;dared not have expected.</p>
<p>Max walked to the window, looked down an instant into the
brilliant, sunlit street, came back to Blake's side, all with a
swift impulsiveness.</p>
<p>"Ned, I am the same friend&mdash;the same comrade?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, yes!"</p>
<p>"But you do not think I possess a soul?"</p>
<p>Blake, taken unawares, colored like any boy.</p>
<p>"Oh, come!"</p>
<p>"But it is true. I know, for I have been told. And you are
wrong&mdash;quite wrong."</p>
<p>Blake was about to laugh, but he looked at the young face,
suddenly grown grave, and his own words came back to him guiltily.
'Max's lips were made for laughter&mdash;his eyes are too bright
for tears!'</p>
<p>"Poor little faun!" he said, with jesting tenderness. "Have I
misjudged you?"</p>
<p>Max nodded seriously. "You have. She has made me realize."</p>
<p>"Ah! That was like her!" It was Blake's turn to walk to the
window; and the boy, watching him eagerly, was unable to place the
constraint that suddenly tinged his voice, suddenly veiled his
manner.</p>
<p>"Ned," he was urged to say, "tell me! Has she brought us nearer
together&mdash;my sister Maxine?"</p>
<p>Blake hesitated; for even your Irishman, brimming to confide, is
reticent when he stands before his holy of holies.</p>
<p>"Ned, tell me!"</p>
<p>The tone was enticing. Blake turned from the window, strode back
across the room, cast an affectionate arm about the boy's
shoulder.</p>
<p>"She is a worker of miracles&mdash;your sister Maxine!"</p>
<p>The words were warm, the clasp was warm; Max's inspiration
gushed up, a fountain of faith.</p>
<p>"She understands you? She shows you 'the higher things'?"</p>
<p>"By God, she does!"</p>
<p>"Then you shall see her once more!" The ideal was predominant;
zeal and youth, the white-hot gifts, were lavished at Blake's feet.
"Come to the studio to-night, and I shall leave you in her company
willingly, gladly, with all my heart. Ned! Say you will come!"</p>
<p>And Blake, dreaming his own dream, pressed the boy's shoulder
and laughed, and answered with the jest that covers so many
things.</p>
<p>"Will I come? Will a man turn back from the gate of heaven when
Saint Peter uses his key?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">PERFECT self-deception can be a rare, almost a
precious thing, ranking with all absurd, delightful faiths from the
child's sweet certainty of fairydom to the enthusiast's belief in
the potency of his own star.</div>
<p>Maxine, in her little white bedroom, arraying herself for Blake,
was wrapped in a cloud of illusion, translated to a sphere above
the common earth by this magic blindness. Never again while life
lasted was she to stand as she stood to-night, eyes searching her
mirror with perfect steadfast sincerity, lips parted in breathless
joy of confidence. Never again! But for the moment the illusion was
complete. She saw the triumphing soul of Max glimmer through her
own fair body, saw the boy's faith carried like a banner in her
woman's hands.</p>
<p>Her dressing was a tremulous affair, tinged with a fine
excitement. Again she clothed herself in the soft white dress, the
long gray cloak of former meetings; but, banishing the willing
Jacqueline, she coiled her hair with her own hands and last, most
significant touch, pinned a white rose at her breast.</p>
<p>It was the night of nights! No need to assure herself of the
fact; the knowledge sang in her blood, burned in her cheeks. The
night of nights! When Maxine would receive the soul of Blake and
place it, mystic and sacramental, in the keeping of Max!</p>
<p>The folly of the affair, the naivety of it, made for tears as
well as smiles; and Maxine, glowing to the eternal, aspiring flame,
looked her last into the little mirror that had so carefully
preserved its secrets, and passed across the hall to the
<i>salon</i>, where the night stretched beckoning, velvet fingers
through the open window.</p>
<p>Young, luxurious summer palpitated through the dusk, fanning the
ardor in her heart. She ran forward, drawn by its allurement; then,
all at once, she stopped, her hand flying to her heart, her breath
suspended in a little cry of surprise. Blake had slipped unheard
into the <i>appartement</i>, and was awaiting her on the
balcony.</p>
<p>At her cry, he turned&mdash;wheeled round toward her&mdash;and
his eyes scanned her surprised, betraying face.</p>
<p>"You are glad!" he cried, in sudden self-expression. "You are
glad to see me!" The words were hot as they were abrupt, they
seared her with their swiftness and their conviction, they were as
a raiding army before which all ramparts fell. Mentally, morally,
she felt herself sway until preconceived ideas drifted to and fro,
weeds upon a tide.</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered, scarcely aware of her own voice. "I am
glad."</p>
<p>Where now were the subtle ways, the divers interlacing paths
wherein Maxine was to pursue her chase, delivering her quarry into
the hands of Max? Where were the barbed and potent shafts whereby
that capture was to be achieved? All had vanished into the night;
she stood before her intended victim unarmed, ungirt,
and&mdash;miracle of miracles&mdash;undismayed!</p>
<p>She and Blake confronted each other. Their lips were dumb, but
their looks embraced. Fate&mdash;life&mdash;was in the air, in the
myriad voices of the night, the myriad pulses of their bodies, the
myriad thoughts that wheeled and flashed within their brains.</p>
<p>This knowledge rushed in upon her swimming senses, upon eyes
suddenly opened, ears suddenly made free of the music of the
spheres; and her hand&mdash;the hand that had first girded on her
boy's attire&mdash;went out to Blake like that of any girl.</p>
<p>It was nature's signal, stronger in its frailty than any
attained art of woman; and he answered to it as man has ever
answered&mdash;ever will answer.</p>
<p>"Oh, my love!" he cried. "My love!" And his arms went round
her.</p>
<p>It is sacrilege to attempt analysis of birth or love or death.
Death and birth, the mysteries! Love, the revelation! Man, as he
has existed through all time, had being in Blake's embrace; woman,
as she has been from the first, lived in Maxine's leap of the
heart, her leap of the spirit as the ecstasy of his touch thrilled
her. Here was no coldness; here was no sensuality. Divinity
manifested itself, no longer above, but within them. The lights in
the sky were divine, but so were the lights of the town. Divinity
fired their souls, merging each in each; but as truly it fired
their clasping hands, their lips trembling to kiss.</p>
<p>Maxine&mdash;removed by fabulous distances from Max, from the
studio, from all accepted things&mdash;breathed her wonderment in
an unconscious appeal.</p>
<p>"Speak to me!"</p>
<p>And Blake, awed and enraptured, whispered his answer.</p>
<p>"There is nothing to say that you do not know. I worship you. I
bent my knee and kissed the hem of your garment the first moment it
brushed my path. There is nothing to say that you do not know. I
have waited all my life for this."</p>
<p>"All your life?"</p>
<p>"All my life. But love is not reckoned by time. One
dreams&mdash;and one wakes."</p>
<p>"You dreamed&mdash;" She closed her eyes, her ears drank in the
cadences of his voice.</p>
<p>"Always! As a child, I dreamed over my play; as a boy, I dreamed
over my books&mdash;and as a man, over my loves. I was never in
love with woman&mdash;always in love with love."</p>
<p>"And now?"</p>
<p>"I am awake&mdash;I have come into my inheritance! My love! My
love!" It was an instant of intense sensation. She could feel the
beating of his heart; his fingers and hers were interlaced.
"Maxine! Open your eyes! Look at me!"</p>
<p>Obediently&mdash;any woman to any man&mdash;she opened them and
met his gaze.</p>
<p>"You know? You understand?"</p>
<p>She stood rigid, her eyes wide, her nostrils dilated&mdash;a
creature swaying upon the verge of an abyss, contemplating a plunge
into space.</p>
<p>"Maxine!" he said again. "Maxine!"</p>
<p>It was the primitive human cry. She heard and acknowledged it in
every fibre of her being; she drew a swift, sharp breath, then,
with a free gesture, cast her arms about his neck.</p>
<p>"Ned! Ned! Say again that you love me! Say it a thousand, say it
a million times and for every time you say it, I will tell you
twice that I love you."</p>
<p>Passion, intoxication sped the words, and Blake's mouth, closing
upon hers, broke the ecstasy of speech.</p>
<p>"I love you! I worship you! You are my life. You are
myself."</p>
<p>Reality vibrated through his speech; and Maxine, hearing, lost
herself. With arms still clasped about him, she leaned her body
backward, gazing into his face.</p>
<p>"Again! Say it again!"</p>
<p>"You are my life! We are one! Maxine! Maxine!" His glance burned
her, his arms were close about her. With a sudden ardent movement,
she caught his face between her hands, drew it down, and kissed it
full upon the mouth, not once but many times, fiercely, closely;
then, with a little cry, inarticulate as the cry of an animal, she
freed herself and fled through the <i>salon</i>, through the hall
and out upon the landing, the door of the <i>appartement</i>
closing behind her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">THE door of her <i>appartement</i> closed behind
Maxine, and she turned, swift as a coursed hare, to the door of M.
Cartel.</div>
<p>No hesitation touched her; she needed sanctuary; sanctuary she
must have. She opened her neighbor's door, careless of what might
lie behind, bringing with her into the quiet rooms a breath of
fierce disorder.</p>
<p>The living-room, with its piano and its homely chairs and table,
was lighted by a common lamp; and the little Jacqueline, the only
occupant, sat in the radius of the light, peacefully sewing at a
blue muslin gown that was to adorn a Sunday excursion into the
country.</p>
<p>At the sound of the stormy entry she merely raised her head; but
at sight of her visitor, she was on her feet in an instant, the
heap of muslin flowing in a blue cascade from her lap to the
floor.</p>
<p>"Madame!"</p>
<p>"Hide me!" cried Maxine.</p>
<p>"Madame!"</p>
<p>"Lock the outer door! And if M. Blake should knock&mdash;"</p>
<p>Jacqueline made no further comment. When a visitor's face is
blanched and her limbs tremble as did those of Maxine, the
Jacquelines of this world neither question nor hesitate. She went
across the room without a word, and the key clicked in the
lock.</p>
<p>Maxine was standing in the middle of the room when Jacqueline
returned; her body was still quivering, her nostrils fluttering,
her fingers twisting and intertwisting in an excess of emotion; and
at sight of the familiar little figure, words broke from her with
the fierceness of a freed torrent.</p>
<p>"Jacqueline! You see before you a mad woman! A mad
woman&mdash;and one filled with the fear of her madness! They say
the insane are mercifully oblivious. It is untrue!" She almost
cried the last words and, turning, began a swift pacing of the
room.</p>
<p>"Madame!" Jacqueline caught her breath at her own daring.
"Madame, you know at last, then, that he loves you?"</p>
<p>Maxine stopped and her burning eyes fixed themselves upon the
girl. This speech of Jacqueline's was a breach of all their former
relations, but her brain had no room for pride. She was grappling
with vital facts.</p>
<p>"I know at last that he loves me?" she repeated, confusedly.</p>
<p>"That he loves you, madame; that, unknowingly, he has always
loved you. How else could he have treated Monsieur Max so
sacredly&mdash;almost as he might have treated his own child?"</p>
<p>But Maxine was not dealing in psychological subtleties.</p>
<p>"Love!" she cried out. "Love! All the world is in a conspiracy
over this love!"</p>
<p>"Because love is the only real thing, madame."</p>
<p>"Perhaps! But not the love of which you speak. The love of the
soul, but not the love of the body!"</p>
<p>"Madame, can one truly give the soul and refuse the body? Is not
the instinct of love to give all?"</p>
<p>The little Jacqueline spoke her truth with a frail confidence
very touching to behold. She was a child of the people, her sole
weapons against the world were a certain blonde beauty, a certain
engaging youthfulness; but she looked Maxine steadfastly in the
eyes, meeting the anger, the scorn, the fear compassed in her
glance.</p>
<p>"I know the world, madame; it is not a pretty place. When I was
sixteen years old, I left my parents because it called to
me&mdash;and in the distance its voice was pleasant. I left my
home; I had lovers." She shrugged her shoulders with an extreme
philosophy. "I tried everything&mdash;except love. Then&mdash;I met
Lucien!" Her philosophy merged curiously to innocence, almost to
the soft innocence of a child. "I ran away again, madame; I fled to
Lize." She paused. "Poor Lize! She has a good heart! That was the
night at the Bal Tabarin. That night Lucien opened his arms, and I
flung myself into them."</p>
<p>She spoke with perfect artlessness, ignorant of a world other
than her own, innocent of a moral code other than that which she
followed.</p>
<p>Once again, as on the day she had first visited the
<i>appartement</i> and made acquaintance with the old painter and
his wife, dread of some mysterious force filled Maxine. What
marvellous power was this that could smile secure at poverty and
oblivion&mdash;that could cast a halo of true emotion over a Bal
Tabarin?</p>
<p>"It is not true!" she cried out, in answer to herself.</p>
<p>"Not true, madame? Why did I choose Lucien, who is nothing to
look upon&mdash;who is an artist and penniless?"</p>
<p>She ran across to Maxine; she caught her by the shoulders.</p>
<p>"Oh, madame! How beautiful you are&mdash;and how blind! You
bandage your eyes, and you tighten the knot. Oh, my God, if I could
but open it for you!"</p>
<p>"And reduce me to kisses and folly and tears?"</p>
<p>"One may drift into heaven on a kiss!" Jacqueline's voice was
like some precious metal, molten and warm.</p>
<p>"Or one may slip into hell! Do you think I have not known what
it is to kiss? It was from a kiss I fled to-night."</p>
<p>Her tone was fervent as it was reckless, and Jacqueline stood
aghast. The entire denial of love was comprehensible to her, if
inexplicable; but her mind refused this problem of realization and
rejection.</p>
<p>"Madame&mdash;" she began, quickly, but she paused on the word,
listening; the sound of Max's door opening and closing came
distinctly to the ear, followed by a footstep descending the
stairs. "Monsieur &Eacute;douard!" she whispered, finger on
lip.</p>
<p>Maxine, also, had heard, and a look of relief broke the tension
of her expression.</p>
<p>"He is gone. That is well!"</p>
<p>Something in her look, in her voice startled Jacqueline
anew.</p>
<p>"Why do you speak like that, madame? Why do you look so
cold?"</p>
<p>"I am sane again, Jacqueline."</p>
<p>"And Monsieur &Eacute;douard? Is he sane, I wonder? Is he cold?
Oh, madame, he loves you!"</p>
<p>"I am going to prove his love."</p>
<p>"But, madame! Oh, madame, love isn't a matter of proving; it is
an affair of giving&mdash;giving&mdash;giving with all the
heart."</p>
<p>"Trust me, Jacqueline! I understand. Good-night!"</p>
<p>Jacqueline framed no word, but her eyes spoke many things.</p>
<p>"Say good-night, Jacqueline! Forget that you have entertained a
mad woman!"</p>
<p>"Good-night, madame!"</p>
<p>But the little Jacqueline, left alone, shook her head many
times, leaving her heap of blue muslin neglected upon the
floor.</p>
<p>"Poor child!" she said softly to herself. "Poor child! Poor
child!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">IT was midway between the hours of nine and ten
on the morning following. Max was standing in the studio; the
easel, still bearing the portrait, had been pushed into a corner,
its face to the wall; everywhere the warm sun fell upon a rigid
severity of aspect, as though the room had instinctively been bared
for the enacting of some scene.</div>
<p>Max himself, in a subtle manner, struck the same note. The old
painting blouse he usually wore had been discarded for the blue
serge suit, severely masculine in aspect; his hair had been reduced
to an usual order, his whole appearance was rigid, active, braced
for the coming moment.</p>
<p>And this moment arrived sooner even than anticipation had
suggested. The clocks of Paris had barely clashed the half hour,
when his strained ears caught a step upon the landing, a sharp
knock upon the door, and before his brain could leap to fear or
joy, Blake was in the <i>appartement</i>&mdash;in the room.</p>
<p>There was no mistaking Blake's attitude as he swung into the
boy's presence; it was patent in every movement, every glance, even
had his white, strained face not testified to it. Coming into the
studio, he affected nothing&mdash;neither apology, greeting, nor
explanation; without preamble he came straight to the matter that
possessed his mind.</p>
<p>"You know of this?" He held out a square white envelope, bearing
bold feminine handwriting&mdash;writing over which time and thought
and labor had been expended in this same room ten hours earlier.
"You know this?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Max's tongue clicked dryly against the roof of his mouth,
but his eyes bore the fire of Blake's scrutiny.</p>
<p>"You know the contents?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"'Yes!' And you can stand there like a graven image. Do you
realize it, at all? Do you grasp it?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;think I understand."</p>
<p>"You think you understand?" Blake laughed in a manner that was
not agreeable. "Understand, forsooth! You, who have never seen
anything human or divine that you rate above your own little
finger! Understand!" He laughed again, then suddenly his attitude
changed. "But I haven't come here to waste words! You know that,
your sister has left Paris?"</p>
<p>Max nodded, finding no words.</p>
<p>"She tells me here that she has gone&mdash;gone out of my
life&mdash;that I am to forget her."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Well, that has only one meaning, when it comes from the one
woman. I must know where she is."</p>
<p>Max set his lips and studiously averted his face.</p>
<p>"Come! Tell me where she is! Time counts."</p>
<p>"I do not know."</p>
<p>"I expected that! You're lying, of course; but when you're up
against a man in my frame of mind, lies are poor ammunition. I
don't ask you why she has gone&mdash;that's between her and me,
that's my affair. But I must know where she is."</p>
<p>"I cannot tell you."</p>
<p>"You cannot refuse to tell me! Look here, boy, you've always
seen my soft side, you don't believe there is a hard one. But we
Irish can surprise you."</p>
<p>Max had no physical fear, but he backed involuntarily before the
menace in Blake's eyes.</p>
<p>"I'm not lying to you, Ned. I cannot tell you, because I do not
know. My sister Maxine has ceased to exist&mdash;for me, as much as
for you."</p>
<p>"Stop!" Blake stepped close to him and for an instant his hand
was raised, but it fell at once to his side, and he laughed once
more, harshly and self-consciously. "Don't play with me, boy! I've
had a hard knock."</p>
<p>"I'm not playing. It's true! It's true!" Dark eyes, with dark
lines beneath them, stared at Blake, carrying conviction. "It's
true! It's true! I do not know."</p>
<p>"God, boy!" Blake faltered in his vehemence.</p>
<p>"It's true!" said Max again.</p>
<p>"True that she's gone&mdash;vanished? That I can't find her?
That you can't find her? It isn't!"</p>
<p>"It is."</p>
<p>The blood rushed into Blake's face. For a moment he stood rigid
and speechless, drinking in the fact; then his feelings broke
bounds.</p>
<p>"It's true? And you stand there, gaping! God, boy, rouse
yourself!" He caught him by the shoulder and shook him. "Don't you
know what this is? Have you never seen a man dealt a mortal
blow?"</p>
<p>"Love is not everything!" cried Max.</p>
<p>"Not everything? Oh, you poor, damned little fool, how bitterly
you'll retract that prating! Not everything? Isn't water everything
in a parched desert? Isn't the sun everything to a frozen world?"
He stopped, suddenly loosing the boy, casting him from him, a thing
of no significance.</p>
<p>Max, faint and pale, caught at his arm.</p>
<p>"Ned! Ned! I am here. I am your friend. I love you."</p>
<p>Blake, in all his whirl of passion, paused.</p>
<p>"You!" he said, and no long eloquence could have accentuated the
blank amazement, the searing irony of the word.</p>
<p>But Max closed all his senses.</p>
<p>"Ned! Ned! Look at the truth of life! There is in me everything
but one thing."</p>
<p>"Then, by God, that one thing is everything! It's the woman and
the man that rule this world. The woman and the man&mdash;the soul
and the body! All other things are dust and chaff."</p>
<p>"You feel that now. But time&mdash;time balances. We will be
happy yet. We will relive the old days&mdash;"</p>
<p>Blake turned, wrenching away his arm. "The old days? Do you
imagine Paris can hold me now she is gone?"</p>
<p>"Ned!"</p>
<p>"Do you imagine I can live in this town&mdash;climb these
steps&mdash;stand on that balcony, that breathes of her?"</p>
<p>Max was leaning back against the window-frame. His brain seemed
empty of blood, his heart seemed to pulse in a strange, unfamiliar
fashion, while somewhere within his consciousness a tiny voice
commanded him urgently to preserve his strength&mdash;not to betray
himself.</p>
<p>"You will go away?" he heard himself say. "Where will you go? To
Ireland?"</p>
<p>"To Ireland&mdash;or hell!" Blake walked to the door.</p>
<p>"Then you are leaving me?"</p>
<p>"You shall know where I am."</p>
<p>"And if I should need you?"</p>
<p>Blake made no answer; he did not even look back.</p>
<p>"If&mdash;if she should need you?"</p>
<p>He turned.</p>
<p>"I will come to her at any moment&mdash;from anywhere."</p>
<p>The door closed. He was gone, and Max stood leaning against the
window. His blood still circulated oddly, and now the inner voice
with its reiterated commands was rising, rising until it became the
thunder of a sea that filled his ears, annihilating all other
sounds. A swift, sharp terror smote him; he sought desperately to
maintain his consciousness, but, breaking across the effort an icy
breath crept up from nowhere, fanning his cheek, suspending all
struggle, and a palpable darkness, like the darkness of brooding
wings, closed in upon him, bringing oblivion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">WHO shall depict the soul of woman? As well
essay to number the silk hairs on the moth's wing, or paint truly
the hues in the blown bubble! The soul of woman dwells apart,
subject to no laws, trammelled by no precedent; mysterious in its
essence, strong in its very frailty, it passes through many phases
to its ultimate end, working as all great agents work, silently and
in the dark.</div>
<p>With the passing of Blake, the spiritual Maxine entered upon a
new phase&mdash;was arbitrarily forced into a new phase of
existence. The passing of Blake was sudden, tremendous, devastating
in its effect, leaving as consequences a moral blackness, a moral
chaos.</p>
<p>It was a new Maxine who wakened to the realization of facts;
rather, it was a new Max, for it was the masculine, not the
feminine ego that turned a set face to circumstance in the moment
of desertion&mdash;that sedulously wrapped itself in the garment of
pride spun and fashioned in happier hours.</p>
<p>'Now is the test! Now is the time!' Max insisted, drowning by
insistence the poignant cry of the heart; and to this watchword he
marched against fate.</p>
<p>With set purpose he faced life and its vexed questions in that
bitter, precipitate moment. Again it was the beginning of things;
but it was the rue M&uuml;ller and not the Gare du Nord that was
the scene of action; the May sun fell burning on the Parisian
pavements, while the blood of the adventurer ran slow and cold. The
illusions bred of the winter dawn had been dispersed by the light
of day; life was no glad enterprise&mdash;no climbing of golden
heights, but the barren crossing of a trackless region where no
hand proffered guidance and false signs misled the weary eyes. One
weapon alone was necessary in the pursuance of the gray
journey&mdash;a sure command&mdash;a sure possession of one's
self!</p>
<p>This thought alone made harmony with the music of the past, and
toward its thin sound his ears were strained. Comradeship had come
and gone&mdash;love had come and gone&mdash;the fundamental idea
that had lured him to Paris alone remained, stark, colorless, but
recognizable!</p>
<p>One must possess one's self! And to achieve this supreme good,
one must close the senses and seal up the heart, and be as a
creature already dead!</p>
<p>To this profound end, Max locked himself in his studio and sat
alone while the May morning waxed; to this profound end, moving as
in a dream, he at last rose at midday and left the
<i>appartement</i> in quest of his customary meal. What that meal
was to consist of&mdash;whether stones or bread&mdash;did not touch
his brain, for his mind was solely exercised with wonder at the
fact that his will could command the search for food&mdash;could
compel his dry lips to the savorless duty of eating.</p>
<p>As he left the little <i>caf&eacute;</i>, paying his score, he
half expected to see his wonder reflected on the good face of
madame the proprietress, and was curiously shocked to receive the
usual cheerful smile, the usual cheerful 'good-day!' that took no
heed of his heavy plight.</p>
<p>It was that cheerful superficiality of Paris that can so
delightfully mirror one's mood when the heart is light&mdash;that
can ring so sadly hollow when the soul is sick. It cut Max with a
bitter sharpness; and, like a man fleeing from his own shadow, he
fled the shop.</p>
<p>Outside in the dazzling glitter of the streets, the sun blinded
him, accentuating the scorching pain of unshed tears; the very
pavements seemed to rise up and sear him with their memories. Here
in this very street Blake and he had strolled and smoked on many a
night, wending homeward from the play or the opera, laughing,
jesting, arguing as they paced arm-in-arm up and down before the
sleeping shops. The thought stung him with an amazing sharpness,
and he fled from it, as he had fled from the <i>caf&eacute;</i> and
its smiling proprietress.</p>
<p>His descent upon Paris was a descent upon a region of beauty.
The sense of summer lay like a bloom upon the flowers for sale at
the street corners, and shimmered&mdash;a ribbon of silver
sunlight&mdash;across the pale-blue sky. The trees in the grand
boulevards shone in their green trappings; rainbow colors glinted
in the shop windows; everywhere, save in the heart of Max, was
fairness and youth and joy.</p>
<p>Supremely conscious of himself, adrift and wretched, he passed
through the crowds of people&mdash;passed from sun to shade, from
shade to sun&mdash;with a hopeless eager haste that possessed no
object save to outstrip his thoughts.</p>
<p>It is a curious fact that, to the desponding, water has a
magnetic call; without knowledge, almost without volition, his
footsteps turned toward the river&mdash;that river which has so
closely girdled Paris through all her varied life. Smooth and pale,
it slipped secretly past its quays as Max approached, indifferent
to the tragedies it concealed, as it was indifferent to the ardent
life that ebbed and flowed across its many bridges. On its breast,
the small, dark craft of the city nestled lazily; to right and left
along its banks, the sun struck glints of gold and bronze from
spire and monument; while, close against its sides, on the very
parapet of its quays, there was in progress that quaint book
traffic that strikes so intimate a note in the life of the
quarter.</p>
<p>It is a charming thought that in the heart of Paris&mdash;Paris,
the pleasure city&mdash;there is time and space for the vender of
old books to set out his wares, to lay them open to the kindly sky,
to tempt the studious and idle alike to pause and dally and lose
themselves in that most fascinating of all pursuits&mdash;- the
search for the treasure that is never found. Max paused beside this
row of tattered bookstalls, and quivered to the stab of a new pain.
Scores of happy mornings he had wandered with Blake in this
vicarious garden of delight, flitting from the books to the curio
shops across the roadway, from the curios back again to the books,
while Blake talked with his easy friendliness to the odd beings who
bartered in this open market.</p>
<p>It was pain inexpressible&mdash;it was loneliness made
palpable&mdash;to stand by the tressel stalls and allow his eyes to
rest upon the familiar merchandise; and for the third time in that
black morning he fled from his own shadow&mdash;fled onward into
the darker, older Paris&mdash;the Paris of tradition, where the
church of Notre Dame frowns, silently scornful of those who disturb
its peace.</p>
<p>As he approached the great building, its sombre impressiveness
fell upon his troubled spirit mercifully as its shadow fell across
the blinding sunlight. He paused in the wide space that fronts the
heavy doors, and caught his breath as the fugitive of old might
have caught breath at sight of sanctuary.</p>
<p>Here was a place of shade and magnitude&mdash;- a place
untouched by memory!</p>
<p>Blindly he moved toward the door, entered the church, walked up
the aisle. Few sight-seers disturbed the sense of peace, for
outside it was high noon and Paris was engrossed in the serious
business of <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>; no service was in progress; all
was still, all dim save where a taper of a lamp glowed before a
shrine or the sun struck sharp through the splendor of stained
glass.</p>
<p>There are few churches&mdash;to some minds there is no other
church&mdash;where the idea of the profound broods as it does in
Notre Dame. The sense of dignity, the curious ancient scent
compounded by time, the mystic colors of the great windows breathe
of the infinite.</p>
<p>Max, walking up the aisle, looked at the dark walls;
Max&mdash;modern, critical&mdash;looked up at the wondrous rose
window, and felt the overshadowing power of superhuman things. The
modern world crumbled before the impassive silence, criticism found
no challenge in its brooding spirit, for the mind cannot analyze
what it cannot measure.</p>
<p>Max subscribed to no creed; but, by a strange impulsion, born of
dead ages, his eyes fell from the glowing window and turned to the
high altar. He did not want to pray; he rebelled against the idea
of supplication; but the circling thoughts within him concentrated
suddenly, he clasped his hands with a clasp so fierce that it was
pain.</p>
<p>"Oh, God!" he said, under his breath. "God! God, let me possess
myself!" And as if some chord had snapped, relieving the tension in
his brain, he dropped upon his knees, as he had once done at the
foot of his own staircase and, crouching against a pillar, wept
like a lost child.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">THE last days of August in Paris! A deadly
oppression of heat; a brooding inertia that lay upon the city like
a cloak!</div>
<p>In the little <i>appartement</i> every window stood gaping,
thirsting for a draught of air; but no stir lightened the haze that
weighed upon the atmosphere, no faintest hint of breeze ruffled the
plantation shrubs, dark in their fulness of summer foliage.
Stillness lay upon Montmartre&mdash;upon the rue
M&uuml;ller&mdash;most heavily of all, upon the home of Max.</p>
<p>It was an obvious, weighty stillness unconnected with repose. It
seemed as though the spirit of the place were fled, and that in its
stead the vacant quiet of death reigned. In the <i>salon</i> the
empty hearth hurt the observer with its poignant suggestion of past
comradeship, dead fires, long hours when the spring gales had
whistled through the plantation and stories had been told and
dreams woven to the spurt of blue and copper flames. The place had
an aspect of desertion; no book lay thrown, face downward, upon
chair or table; no flowers glowed against the white walls, though
flowers were to be had for the asking in a land that teemed with
summer fruitfulness.</p>
<p>This was the <i>salon</i>; but in the studio the note of loss
was still more sharply struck. Not because the easel, drawn into
the full light, offered to the gaze a crude, unfinished study, nor
yet because a laden palette was cast upon the floor to consort with
tubes and brushes, but because the presiding genius of the place
Max&mdash;Max the debonair, Max the adventurous&mdash;was seated on
a chair before his canvas, a prey to black despair.</p>
<p>Max was thinner. The great heat of August&mdash;or some more
potent cause&mdash;had smoothed the curves from his youthful face,
drawn the curled lips into an unfamiliar hardness and painted
purple shadows beneath the eyes. Max had fought a long fight in the
three months that had dwindled since the morning of Blake's going,
and a long moral fight has full as many scars to leave behind as a
battle of physical issues. The saddest human experience is to view
alone the scenes one has viewed through other eyes&mdash;to walk
solitary where one has walked in company&mdash;to have its
particular barbed shaft aimed at one from every stick and stone
that mark familiar ways. All this Max had known, wrapping himself
in his pride, keeping long silence, fighting his absurd, brave
fight.</p>
<p>'The first days will be the worst!' he had assured himself,
walking back from Notre Dame in the searching sun, heedless of who
might notice his red eyes. 'The first days will be the worst!' And
this formula he had repeated in the morning, standing uninspired
and wretched before a blank canvas. Then had come Blake's first
message&mdash;a note written from Sweden without care or comfort,
importing nothing, indicating nothing beyond the place at which the
writer might be found, and tears&mdash;torrents of tears&mdash;had
testified to the fierce anticipation, the crushing disappointment
for which it was responsible.</p>
<p>He had sent no answer to the cold communication&mdash;no answer
had been desired, and calling himself by every name contempt could
coin, he had pushed forward along the lonely road, companioned by
his work. But he himself had once said: 'One must come naked and
whole to art, as one must come naked and whole to nature,' and he
had spoken a truth. Art is no anodyne for a soul wounded in other
fields, and Art closed arms to him when most he wooed her. He threw
himself into work with pitiable vehemence in those first black
weeks. By day, he haunted the galleries and attended classes like
any art student; by night, he ranged the streets and
<i>caf&eacute;s</i>, seeking inspiration, returning to his lonely
room to lie wakeful, fighting his ghosts, or else to sob himself to
sleep.</p>
<p>His theory of life had been amply proved. Blake had prated of
the soul, but it had been the body he had desired! Again and again
that thought had struck home, a savage spur goading him in daytime
to a wild plying of his brushes, gripping him in the lonely
darkness of the night-time until his sobs were suspended by their
very poignancy and the scalding tears dried before they could
fall.</p>
<p>He saw darkly, he saw untruly, but the world is according to the
beholder's vision, and in those sultry days, when summer waxed and
Paris emptied, opening its gates to the foreigner, all the colors
had receded from existence and he had tasted the lees of life.</p>
<p>And now to-day it seemed that the climax had been reached.
Seated idly before his canvas, the whole procession of his Paris
life unwound before him&mdash;from the first tumultuous hour, when
he had entered the H&ocirc;tel Railleux on fire for freedom, to
this moment when, with dull resentful eyes, he confronted the sum
of his labors&mdash;an unfinished, sorry study devoid of
inspiration.</p>
<p>He stared at the flat canvas&mdash;the rough outline of his
picture&mdash;the reckless splashing on of color; and, abruptly, as
if a hand had touched him, he sprang to his feet, making havoc
among the paint tubes that strewed the floor, and turned summarily
to the open window.</p>
<p>It was after eight o'clock, but the hazy, unreal daylight of a
summer evening made all things visible. He scanned the plantation,
viewing it as if in some travesty of morning; he looked down upon
the city, sleeping uneasily in preparation for the inevitable night
of pleasure, and a sudden loathing of Paris shook him. It seemed as
if some gauzy illusive garment had been lifted from a fair body and
that his eyes, made free of the white limbs, had discerned a
corpse.</p>
<p>By a natural flight of ideas, the loathing of the city turned to
loathing of himself&mdash;to an unsatiable desire for
self-forgetfulness, for self-effacement. Solitude was no longer
tenable, the walls of the <i>appartement</i> seemed to close in
about him, stifling&mdash;suffocating him. With a feverish
movement, he turned from the window, picked up his hat and fled the
room.</p>
<p>On the landing he paused for a moment before the door of M.
Cartel. He had paid many visits to M. Cartel under stress of
circumstances similar to this, and invariably M. Cartel&mdash;and,
moving in his shadow, the demure Jacqueline&mdash;had proffered a
generous hospitality&mdash;talking to him of work, of politics, of
Paris, but with a Frenchman's inimitable tact.</p>
<p>For all this unobtrusive attention he had been silently
grateful, but to-night he stood by the door hesitating; for long he
hesitated, honestly fighting with his mood, but at last the
desperation of the mood prevailed. Who could talk of work, when
work was as an evil smell in the nostrils? Who could talk of
politics, when the overthrow of nations would not stimulate the
mind? He turned on his heel with a little exclamation, hopeless as
it was cynical, and ran down the stairs with the gait of one whose
destination concerns neither the world nor himself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">MAX swung down the Escalier de Sainte-Marie in
as reckless a mood as ever possessed being of either sex. Nothing
of the sweet Maxine was discernible in face or carriage; the boy
predominated, but a boy possessed of a callousness that was
pathetic seen hand-in-hand with youth.</div>
<p>For the first time he was viewing Paris bereft of the glamour of
romance; for the first time the Masque of Folly passed before him,
licentious and unashamed. Many an hour, in days gone by, he had
discussed with Blake this lighter side of many-sided Paris, and
with Blake's wise and penetrating gaze he had seen it in true
perspective; but to-night there was no sane interpreter to temper
vision, to-night he was bitterly alone, and his mind, from long
austerity, long concentration upon work, had swung with grievous
suddenness to the opposing pole of thought. He had no purpose in
his descent from the rue M&uuml;ller, he had no desire of vice as
an antidote to pain, but his loathing of Paris was drawing him to
her with that morbid craving to hurt and rehurt his bruised soul
that assails the artist in times of misery.</p>
<p>The streets were quiet, for it was scarcely nine o'clock, and as
yet the lethargy of the day lay heavy on the air. The heat and the
accompanying laxity breathed an atmosphere of its own; every window
of every house gaped, and behind the casements one caught visions
of men and women negligent of attire and heedless of
observation.</p>
<p>Romance was dead! Of that supreme fact Max was very sure. A hard
smile touched his lips, and hugging his cynicism, he went
forward&mdash;crossing the Boulevard de Clichy, plunging downward
into the darker regions of the rue des Martyrs and the rue
Montmartre, where the lights of the boulevards are left behind, and
the sight-seer is apt to look askance at the crude facts that the
street lamps divulge to his curious eyes. To the boy, these corners
had no terrors, for in his untarnished friendship with Blake all
sides of life had been viewed in turn, as all topics had been
discussed as component parts of a fascinatingly interesting world.
To-night he went forward, mingling with the inhabitants of the
district, revelling with morbid realism in the forbidding dinginess
of their appearance. He was not of that quarter&mdash;that was
patent to every rough who lounged outside a <i>caf&eacute;</i>
door, as it was patent to every slovenly woman who gave him a
glance in passing. He was not of the quarter, but he was an
artist&mdash;and a shabby one at that&mdash;so the men accorded him
an indifferent shrug and the women a second glance.</p>
<p>Forward he went, possessed by his morbidity&mdash;forward into
the growing murkiness of environment until, association of ideas
suddenly curbing impulse, he stopped before the door of a shabby
<i>caf&eacute;</i> bearing the fanciful appellation of the
Caf&eacute; des Cerises-jumelles. Once, when bound upon a night
exploration in this same region, he and Blake had stopped to smile
at this odd name and wonder at its origin, and finally they had
passed through the portal to find that the twin cherries smiled
upon doubtful patrons. The vivid memory of that night smote him now
as, drawn by some unquestioned influence, he again entered the
<i>caf&eacute;</i>, passing through a species of bar to a long,
low-ceiled eating-room set with small tables. How Blake had talked
that night! How thoughtfully, how humanely and tolerantly he had
judged their fellow-guests, as they sat at one of these tables,
rubbing shoulders with the worst&mdash;or, as he had laughingly
insisted, the best&mdash;of an odd fraternity!</p>
<p>The recollection was keen as a knife when Max entered the
eating-room, sat down and ordered a drink with the supreme
indifference of disillusion. Six months ago he would have trembled
to find himself alone in such a place; to-night he was beyond such
a commonplace as fear.</p>
<p>He smiled again cynically, emptied his glass and looked about
him. His first experience of the place had been in the hours
succeeding midnight, when the quarter hummed with its unsavory
life; but now it was early, the lights were not yet at their
fullest, the waiters had not as yet taken on their nocturnal air of
briskness. In one corner three men were engrossed in a game of
cards, in another a thin girl of fifteen sat with her arm round the
neck of a boy scarce older than herself, whispering jests into his
ear, at which they both laughed in coarse low murmurs, while in the
middle of the room, with her back turned to him, a woman in a tight
black dress and feathered hat was eating a meal of poached
eggs.</p>
<p>In a vague way, absorbed in his own thoughts, Max fell to
studying this solitary woman, until something in her impassivity,
something in the sphinx-like calm with which she went through the
business of her meal, blent with his imaginings, and he suddenly
found her placed beside Blake in the possession of his
thoughts&mdash;an integral part of their joint lives. In a flash of
memory the large black hat, the opulent figure took place within
his consciousness and, answering to a new instinct, he rose and
took an involuntary step in the woman's direction.</p>
<p>She changed her position at sound of his approach, her large hat
described new angles, and she looked back over her shoulder.</p>
<p>"What!" she said aloud. "The little friend of Blake! But how
droll!"</p>
<p>She showed no surprise, she merely waved her hand to a chair
facing her own.</p>
<p>Max sat down; a hot and dirty waiter came forward languidly, and
wine was ordered.</p>
<p>Lize pushed aside the glass of green-tinted liquid that she had
been consuming through a straw, and waited for what was to come.
Max, looking at her in the crude light of a gas-jet, saw that her
face was whiter, her eyes more hollow than when her wrath had
fallen on him at the Bal Tabarin; also, he noted that a little dew
of heat showed through the mask of powder on her face.</p>
<p>Silence was maintained until the wine was brought; then she
drank thirstily, laid down her empty glass and turned her eyes upon
him.</p>
<p>"You have parted with your friend, eh?"</p>
<p>The surprise of the question was so sharp that it killed
speculation. He did not ask how she had probed his
secret&mdash;whether by mere intuition or through some feminine
confidence of Jacqueline's. The fact of her knowledge swept him
beyond the region of lucid thought; he accepted the situation as it
was offered.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said. "I have parted with my friend."</p>
<p>"And why? He is a good boy&mdash;Blake!" She looked at him with
her inscrutable eyes, and after many days he was conscious of the
touch of human compassion. He did not analyze the woman's
feelings&mdash;he did not even conjecture whether she knew him for
boy or girl. All he comprehended was that out of this sordid
atmosphere&mdash;out of the lethargy of the sultry night&mdash;some
force had touched him, some force was drawing him back into the
circle of human things. Strange indeed are the workings of the
mind. He, who had shrunk with an agonized sensitiveness from the
sympathy of M. Cartel&mdash;from the tender comprehension of the
little Jacqueline&mdash;suddenly felt his reserve melt and break in
presence of this woman of the boulevards with her air of impassive
<i>ennui</i>. Theoretically, he knew life in all its harder
aspects, and it called for no vivid imagination to trace the
descent of the fresh <i>grisette</i> of the <i>Quartier Latin</i>
to the creature who sought her meals in the Caf&eacute; des
Cerises-jumelles, yet hers was the accepted compassion.</p>
<p>"Madame!" he said, suddenly. "Madame, tell me! You knew him
once?"</p>
<p>Lize wiped the dew of heat from her forehead; emptied a second
glass of wine. "A thousand years ago, <i>mon petit</i>, when the
world was as young as you!"</p>
<p>"In the <i>Quartier</i>?"</p>
<p>"In the <i>Quartier</i>&mdash;on the Boul' Mich'&mdash;at
Bulliers&mdash;" She stopped, falling into a dream; then, suddenly,
from the farthest corner of the room, came the sound of a loud
kiss, and the boy and girl at the distant table began to sing in
unison&mdash;a ribald song, but instinct with the zest of life.
Lize started, as though she had been struck.</p>
<p>"They have it&mdash;youth!" she cried, with a jerk of her head
toward the distant corner. "The world is for them!" Then her voice
and her expression altered. She leaned across the table, until her
face was close to Max.</p>
<p>"What a little fool you are!" she said. "It is written in those
eyes of yours&mdash;that see too little and see too much. Go home!
Think of what I have said! He is a good boy&mdash;this Blake!"</p>
<p>Max mechanically replenished her glass, and mechanically she
drank; then she produced a little mirror and made good the ravages
of the heat upon her face with the nonchalance of her kind;
finally, she looked at the clock.</p>
<p>"Come!" she said. "We go the same way."</p>
<p>He rose obediently. He made no question as to her destination.
He had come to drown himself in the sordidness of Paris and,
behold, his heart was beating with a human quickness it had not
known since the moment he held Blake's first letter unopened in his
hand; his throat was dry, his eyes were smarting with the old,
half-forgotten smart of unshed tears.</p>
<p>He followed her with a strange docility as she passed out of the
unsavory Cerises-jumelles into the close, ill-smelling street. In
complete silence they walked through what seemed a nightmare world
of unpleasant sights, unpleasant sounds, until across his dazed
thoughts the familiar sense of Paris&mdash;the sense of the
pleasure-chase&mdash;swept from the Boulevard de Clichy.</p>
<p>Lize paused; he saw her fully in the brave
illumination&mdash;the large black hat, the close-clad figure, the
pallid face&mdash;and as he looked, she smiled unexpectedly and,
putting out her hand, patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"Good-bye, <i>mon enfant</i>! Go home! Youth comes but once; and
this Blake&mdash;he is a good boy!"</p>
<p>Before he could answer, before he could return smile or touch,
she was gone&mdash;absorbed into the maze of lights, and he was
alone, to turn which way he would.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">THE fifth floor was dim and silent, the door of
M. Cartel's <i>appartement</i> was closed; but Max, mounting the
stairs two steps at a time, was not daunted by silence or lack of
light. Max was once again a prey to impulse, and under the familiar
tyranny, his blood burned&mdash;raced in his veins, sang in his
cars.</div>
<p>Without an instant's pause, he knocked on M. Cartel's door, and
when his knock was answered by Jacqueline&mdash;fair and
cool-looking, oven in the great heat&mdash;words rushed from him as
they had been wont to rush when life was a gay affair.</p>
<p>"You are alone, Jacqueline?"</p>
<p>Jacqueline nodded quickly, comprehending a crisis.</p>
<p>"Ah, I thank God!" He caught both her hands; he gave a little
laugh that ended in a sob; he passed into the <i>appartement</i>,
drawing her with him.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>la, la</i>!" she cried, hiding her emotion in flippancy,
"you take my breath away."</p>
<p>Max laughed again. "You see I've lost my own!"</p>
<p>She gave a scornful, familiar toss of the head. "Do not be
foolish! What has happened?"</p>
<p>"I have made a discovery, Jacqueline. Youth comes but once!"</p>
<p>"Indeed! You need not have left the rue M&uuml;ller to learn
that."</p>
<p>"It comes but once, and while it is with me I am going to look
it in the face." His words tumbled forth, pell-mell, and as he
spoke he pulled her forcibly into the living-room.</p>
<p>"Jacqueline, I am serious. I have been down in hell; I must see
heaven, or my faith is lost."</p>
<p>Jacqueline stood very still, making no effort to loose the hot
clasp of his hands, but all at once her gaze concentrated
piercingly.</p>
<p>"You have sent for him!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"I have! Oh, I may be weak, but listen! listen! In the old days
when the world was religious and people observed Lent, there was
always <i>Mi-Car&ecirc;me</i>, was there not? Well, I have fasted,
and now I must feast."</p>
<p>They gazed at each other; the one aglow with anticipation, the
other with curiosity.</p>
<p>"You have sent for him&mdash;at last?"</p>
<p>"I have sent a telegram with these words: 'Meet me at midday on
Tuesday in the Place de la Concorde.&mdash;MAXINE.'"</p>
<p>"And this is Friday," said Jacqueline. "In four days' time you
will see him again!"</p>
<p>"Again!" Max spoke the word inaudibly.</p>
<p>"And&mdash;when you meet?" Jacqueline's blue eyes were sharp as
needle-points.</p>
<p>Max colored to the temples. "<i>Ma ch&eacute;rie,</i> I have not
even thought! All I know is that youth comes but once, and that
youth is courage. I have been a coward&mdash;I am going to be
brave."</p>
<p>"You are going&mdash;to confess?"</p>
<p>Max said nothing, but with her woman's instinct for such things,
Jacqueline read assent in the silence.</p>
<p>"Then the end is assured! He will take you&mdash;with your will,
or without! Monsieur Max, or the princess!"</p>
<p>Max shook his head. "I do not think so. But that is outside the
moment&mdash;that is the afterward. First there must be midday and
the Place de la Concorde! First there must be my
<i>Mi-Car&ecirc;me</i>&mdash;my hour!"</p>
<p>"Ah!" whispered the little Jacqueline, "your hour!" And who
shall say what memories glinted through her quick brain&mdash;what
conjurings of the first waltz with M. Cartel at the Moulin de la
Galette, and the last waltz at the Bal Tabarin, when she stepped
through the tawdry doorway into her paradise? "Your hour! And where
will it be spent&mdash;madame?"</p>
<p>"Ah!" Max's eyes sought heaven or, in lieu of heaven, M.
Cartel's ceiling; Max's hands freed Jacqueline's and flew out in
ecstatic gesture. "Ah, that is for the gods to say,
<i>ch&eacute;rie</i>! And the gods know best."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">RAPTURE gilded the world; rapture trembled on
the air like the vibrations of a chord struck from some celestial
harp. Coming as a divine gift, the first autumnal frost had lighted
upon Paris; during the night fainting August had died, and with the
dawn, golden September had been born to the city.</div>
<p>Blake, waiting at the foot of the Cours la Reine, consumed with
anticipation, drank in the freshness of the morning as though it
were a draught of wine; Maxine, crossing the Place de la Concorde,
lifted her face to the sky, striving to quiet her pulses, to cool
her hot cheeks in the wash of gentle air.</p>
<p>Her hour had arrived; none could hinder its approach, as none
could mar its beauty. She scarcely recognized the earth upon which
she trod; the fierce excitement, the melting tenderness of her
moods warred until emotion ran riot and the sifting of her feelings
became a task impossible.</p>
<p>She passed the spot where, eight months earlier, Max had saluted
the flag of France. Her heart leaped, her glance, flying before
her, discovered Blake waiting at his appointed place, and all her
wild sensations were suspended.</p>
<p>The violently beating heart seemed to stop, the blood moved with
a sick slowness in her veins, it seemed impossible that she should
go forward, and yet, by the curious mechanism of the human machine,
her feet carried her on until Blake's presence was tangible to all
her senses&mdash;until suspense was engulfed in actuality, and joy
was singing about her in the air, a song so triumphant, so
penetrating that it drowned all whispering of doubt&mdash;all
murmurs of to-morrow or of yesterday. Tears welled into her eyes,
her hands went out to him.</p>
<p>Standing in the full light, she was a tall, slight girl,
fastidiously, if simply dressed&mdash;veiled, gloved, shod as
befitted a woman of the world; and as he gazed on her, one thought
possessed Blake. She, who typified all beauty&mdash;whose presence
was a fragrance&mdash;had called to him, chosen him. All the
romance stored up through generations welled within him; he would
have died for her at that moment as enthusiastically as his
ancestors had died for their faith. Catching her hands, he kissed
them without a thought for passing glances.</p>
<p>"Princess!"</p>
<p>The sound of his voice went through her, she laughed to break
the sob that caught her throat, she looked up, unashamed of the
tears trembling on her lushes.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Ned!"</p>
<p>"Oh, why the 'monsieur'?"</p>
<p>"Why the 'princess'?"</p>
<p>They both smiled.</p>
<p>"Maxine!"</p>
<p>"<i>Mon ami! Mon cher ami</i>!" It thrilled her to the heart to
say the words; she glanced at him half fearfully, then broke forth
afresh, lest he should have time to think. "Ned, tell me! It is
true&mdash;all this? I am not asleep? It is not a dream?"</p>
<p>He pressed her hands. "Look round you! It is morning."</p>
<p>Her lips trembled; she obeyed him, looking slowly from the cool
sky to the tree-tops, where the heavy leaves were still damp with
the night's frost.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is morning!" she said. "We have all the day!"</p>
<p>Watching her intently, he did not add, as would the common
lover, "we have many days"; she seemed to him so beautiful, so
na&iuml;ve that her words must compass perfection.</p>
<p>"We have all the day," he echoed. "How shall it be spent?"</p>
<p>Then she turned to him, all graciousness, her young face lifted
to the light. "Ah, you must decide! I do not wish even to think;
the world is so&mdash;how do you say&mdash;enchanted?"</p>
<p>He laughed in delight at her charming, pleading smile, her
charming, pleading hesitation; he caught her mood with swift
intuition.</p>
<p>"That's it! The world is enchanted! Away behind us, is the
Dreaming Wood. What do you say? Shall we go and seek the Sleeping
Beauty?"</p>
<p>She nodded silently. He was so perfectly the Blake of
old&mdash;the Blake who understood.</p>
<p>"Then the first thing is to find the magic coach! We must have
nothing so mundane as a carriage drawn by horses. A magic coach
that travels by itself!" He signalled to a passing automobile.</p>
<p>"Drive to the Pr&eacute; Catelan&mdash;and drive slowly!" he
directed; he handed her to her seat with all the courtliness proper
to the occasion, and they were off, wheeling up the long incline
toward the Arc de Triomphe.</p>
<p>They were silent while the chauffeur made a way through the many
vehicles, past the crowds of pedestrians that infest the entrance
to the Bois; but as the way grew clearer&mdash;as the spell of the
trees, of the green vistas and glimpsed water began to weave
itself&mdash;Maxine turned and laid her hand gently upon
Blake's.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon cher</i>! How good you are!"</p>
<p>He started, thrilling at her touch.</p>
<p>"My dearest! Good?"</p>
<p>"In coming to me like this&mdash;"</p>
<p>He caught her hand quickly. "Don't!" he said. "Don't! It isn't
right&mdash;- from you to me. You never doubted that I'd come? You
knew I'd come?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I knew."</p>
<p>"Then that's all right!" He pressed her hand, he smiled, he
reassured her by all the subtle, intangible ways known to lovers,
and it was borne in upon her that he had altered, had grown
mentally in his months of exile&mdash;that he was steadier, more
certain of life or of himself, than when he had rushed
tempestuously out of Max's studio. She pondered the change, without
attempting to analyze it; a deep sense of rest possessed her, and
she allowed her hand to lie passive in his until, all too soon,
their cab swept round to the left, sped past a bank of greenery and
drew up, with a creaking of brakes, before the restaurant of the
Pr&eacute; Catelan.</p>
<p>Everywhere was light, silence and, best boon of all, an
unexpected solitude&mdash;a solitude that invested the white
building with a glamour of unreality and converted the
slight-stemmed, moss-grown trees into spellbound sentinels.</p>
<p>"Here is the Castle!" said Blake. "Look! Even the waiters doze,
until we come to wake them!" He handed her to the ground, gave his
orders to the chauffeur, and as the cab disappeared into some
unseen region, they mounted the wide steps.</p>
<p>"Monsieur desires <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>?" A sleek waiter
disengaged himself from his brethren and came persuasively forward.
At this early hour everything at the Pr&eacute; Catelan was soft
and soothing; later in the day things would alter, the service
would be swift and unrestful, the swish of motor-cars and the hum
of voices would break the spell, but at this hour of noon Paris,
for some obscure reason, ignored the fruitful oasis of the Bois,
and peace lay upon it like balm.</p>
<p>"How charming! Oh, but how charming!" The exclamation was won
from Maxine as her glance skimmed the palms, the glittering glasses
and the white table-linen, and rested upon the spacious windows
that convey the fascinating impression that one whole wall of the
room has been removed, and that the ranged trees outside with their
satiny green stems actually commune with the <i>gourmet</i> as he
eats his meal.</p>
<p>"It's what you wanted, isn't it?" Blake's pleasure in her
pleasure was patent. Every look, every gesture manifested it.</p>
<p>"It is wonderful!" she said, gently.</p>
<p>"Good! And now, what is the meal to be? Dragon's wings <i>en
casserole</i>? Or Moonbeams <i>surprise</i>?"</p>
<p>She laughed, and a flash of mischief stole through the glance
she gave him.</p>
<p>"What do you say, <i>mon ami</i>, to <i>poulet bonne
femme</i>?"</p>
<p>She watched for a gleam of remembrance, but he was too engrossed
in the present to recall the trivialities of the past. He gave the
order without a thought save to do her will.</p>
<p>Delay was inevitable, and while the meal was in preparation they
wandered into the open and visited the farm at the rear of the
restaurant, conjuring the farm-like traditions of the place after
the accepted custom&mdash;entering the sweet-smelling, shadowy
cow-shed, stroking the sleek, soft-breathing cows, amusing
themselves over the antics of the monkey chained beside the
door.</p>
<p>It was all very pleasant, the illusion of Arcadia was charmingly
rendered, and they returned, happy and hungry, in search of their
meal. That meal from its first morsel was raised above common
things, for was it not the first time Blake had broken bread with
Maxine? And what true lover ever forgets the rare moment when all
the joys of intimacy are foreshadowed in the first serving of his
lady with no matter what triviality of meat or bread, or water or
wine? The points of the affair are so slight and yet so tremendous;
for are they not sacramental&mdash;a typifying of things
unspeakable?</p>
<p>No intimate word was spoken, but at such times looks
speak&mdash;more poignantly still, hearts speak; and their gay
voices, as they laughed and talked and laughed again, held notes
that the ear of the waiter never caught, and their silences
vibrated with meaning.</p>
<p>At last the meal was over; they rose and by one consent looked
toward the spacious world outside.</p>
<p>"Shall we go into the gardens?"</p>
<p>Blake put the question; Maxine silently bent her head.</p>
<p>Softly and assiduously their sleek waiter bowed them to the
door, and they passed down the shallow steps into the slim shadows
of the trees as they might have passed into some paradise fashioned
for their special pleasure.</p>
<p>It was a place&mdash;an hour&mdash;removed from the mundane
world; passing out of the region of the trees, they came upon a
shrubbery&mdash;a shrubbery that enclosed a lawn and flower-beds,
and here, by grace of the gods, was a seat where they sat down side
by side and gave their eyes to the beauty that encompassed
them.</p>
<p>It was an exotic beauty, yet a beauty of intense suggestion.
Summer lay lavishly displayed in the shaven lawn, the burdened
shrubs, the glory of flowers, but over her redundant loveliness
autumn had spun an ethereal garment. No words could paint the
subtlety of this sheath; it was neither mist nor shadow, it was a
golden transparency spun from nature's loom&mdash;the bridal veil
of the young season.</p>
<p>"How exquisite!" whispered Maxine, as if a breath might break
the spell. "Look at those yellow butterflies above the flowers!
They are the only moving things."</p>
<p>"It is the place of the Sleeping Beauty, sweet! It is the place
of love." Blake took her hands again and kissed them; then, with a
gentle, enveloping tenderness, he drew her to him, looking into her
face, but not attempting to touch it.</p>
<p>"My sweet, I have come back. What are you going to do with
me?"</p>
<p>She did not answer; she lay quite still within his arms, her
half-closed eyes lingering on the garden&mdash;on the white roses,
the clustering mignonette, the hovering yellow butterflies.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do with me?"</p>
<p>She lifted her eyes, dewy with the beauty of the world.</p>
<p>"Wait!" she whispered. "Oh, wait!"</p>
<p>"I have waited."</p>
<p>"Ah, but a little longer!"</p>
<p>"But my love, my dear one&mdash;"</p>
<p>She stirred in his embrace; she turned with a swift passion of
entreaty, putting her fingers across his mouth.</p>
<p>"Ned! Ned! I know. But do this great thing for me! Shut your
eyes and your ears. Forget yesterday, think there will be no
to-morrow. Hold this one moment! Give me my one hour!"</p>
<p>She pleaded as if for life, her body vibrating, her eyes
beseeching him; and his answer was to press her hand harder against
his lips, and to kiss it fervently. He gave no sign of the struggle
within him&mdash;the doubt that encompassed him. Something had been
demanded of him, and he gave it loyally.</p>
<p>"There was no yesterday, there will be no to-morrow!" he said.
"But to-day is ours!"</p>
<p>It was the perfect word, spoken perfectly; Maxine's eyes drooped
in supreme content, her lips curled like a pleased child's.</p>
<p>"Ah, but God is good!" she said, and with a child's supreme
sweetness, she lifted her face for his kiss.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">THE hour was sped, the day past; night, with its
dark wings, covered the eastern sky and, one by one, the stars came
forth&mdash;stars that gleamed like new silver in the light
sharpness of the September air.</div>
<p>Having closed eyes to the world at the Pr&eacute; Catelan,
Maxine and Blake had lengthened the coil of their dream as the day
waxed. Three o'clock had seen them driving into the heart of the
Bois, and late afternoon had found them wandering under the formal,
interlaced trees in the gardens of the Petit Trianon. At Versailles
they dined, falling a little silent over their meal, for neither
could longer hold at bay the sense that events impended&mdash;that
all paths, however devious, however touched by the enchanter's
wand, lead back by an unalterable law to the world of
realities.</p>
<p>With an unspoken anxiety they clung to the last moment of their
meal; and when coffee had been partaken of, Maxine demanded yet
another cup and, resting her elbows on the table, took her face
between her hands.</p>
<p>"Ned! Will you not offer me a cigarette?"</p>
<p>He was all confusion at seeming remiss.</p>
<p>"My dear one! A thousand pardons! I did not think&mdash;"</p>
<p>"&mdash;That I smoked? Are you disappointed?"</p>
<p>He smiled. "It is one charm the more&mdash;if there is room for
one."</p>
<p>He handed her a cigarette and lighted a match, his eyes resting
upon her as she drew in the first breath of smoke with a quaint
seriousness that smote him with a thought of the boy.</p>
<p>"Dearest," he said, suddenly, "I have been so happy to-day that
I have thought of no one but ourselves, and now, all at
once&mdash;"</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed up to his; she divined his thought, and it was
as though she put forth all her strength to ward off a physical
danger.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>mon cher</i>, and was it not your day&mdash;our day?
Would you have marred it with other thoughts?"</p>
<p>"No; but yet&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No! No!" She put out her hand, she pleaded with eyes and lips
and voice. "Look! Until this little cigarette is burned out!" She
held up the glowing tip. "When that is over, our day is over; then
we return to the world&mdash;but not until then. Is it&mdash;what
do you say&mdash;a bargain?" Her white teeth flashed, her glance
flashed with the brightness of tears, her fingers rested for a
second upon his.</p>
<p>The restaurant was practically empty; a few summer tourists were
dining at tables close to the door, but Blake had chosen the
farthest, dimmest corner and there they sat in semi-isolation,
living the last moments of their day with an intensity that neither
dared to express and that each was conscious of with every beat of
the heart.</p>
<p>Maxine laughed as she drew her second puff of smoke, but her
laugh had a nervous thinness. Blake filled their liqueur-glasses,
but his gesture was uneven and a little of the brandy spilled upon
the cloth.</p>
<p>"A libation to the gods!" he said. "May they smile upon us!" He
lifted his glass and emptied it.</p>
<p>Maxine forced a smile. "The gods know best!" she said, but as
she raised her glass, her hand, also, trembled.</p>
<p>But Blake ignored her perturbation, as she ignored his. The
coming ordeal lay stark across their path, but neither would look
upon it, neither would see beyond the tip of Maxine's
cigarette&mdash;the tiny beacon, consuming even as it gave
light!</p>
<p>A silence fell&mdash;a silence of full five minutes&mdash;then
Blake, yielding once more to the craving for the solace of contact,
put his hand over hers.</p>
<p>"Dear one, I know nothing of what is coming, but that I am
utterly in your hands. But let me say one thing. To-day has been
heaven&mdash;the golden, the seventh heaven!"</p>
<p>She said nothing, she did not meet his eyes, but her cold
fingers clasped his convulsively, and two tears fell hot upon their
hands.</p>
<p>That was all; that was the sum of their expression. No other
word was spoken. They sat silent, watching the cigarette burn
itself out between Maxine's fingers.</p>
<p>She held it to the very last, then dropped it into her
finger-bowl and rose.</p>
<p>"Now, <i>mon cher</i>!" In the dim light she looked very tall
and slight and seemed possessed of a curious dignity. All the
animation had left her face, beneath the eyes were shadows, and in
the eyes a tragic sadness&mdash;the sadness that the soul creates
for itself.</p>
<p>Blake rose also and, side by side, very quietly, they left the
restaurant. In the street outside, the cab that had assisted in the
day's adventures still waited their pleasure.</p>
<p>He handed her to her place and paused, his foot upon the
step.</p>
<p>"And now, liege lady&mdash;where?"</p>
<p>She looked at him gravely and answered without a tremor, "To
Max's studio."</p>
<p>Surprise&mdash;if surprise touched him&mdash;showed not at all
upon his face. He gave the order quietly and explicitly, and took
his place beside her.</p>
<p>Down the broad street of Versailles they wheeled, but both were
too preoccupied to see the lurking ghosts of a past
<i>r&eacute;gime</i> that lie so palpably in the shadows, and
presently Blake's hand found hers once more.</p>
<p>"You are cold?"</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>Through the cool night they drove, under the jewelled cloak of
the sky, rushing forward toward Paris as Max had once rushed in the
mysterious north express.</p>
<p>Blake did not speak or move again until the city was close about
them; then, with a gesture that startled her by its unexpectedness,
he drew from his hand the signet ring he always wore&mdash;a ring
familiar to Max as the stones of the rue M&uuml;ller&mdash;and
slipped it over her third finger.</p>
<p>"Oh, Ned!" She started as the ring slipped into place, and her
voice trembled with fear and superstition.</p>
<p>He pressed her hand. "Don't refuse it! The ring is the emblem of
the eternal, and all my thoughts for you belong to eternity."</p>
<p>No more was said; they skimmed through the familiar ways until
Maxine could have cried aloud for grace, and at last they stopped
at the corner of the rue Andr&eacute; de Sarte.</p>
<p>She stood aside as Blake dismissed the cab, she knew that had
speech been demanded of her then she could not have brought forth a
word, so parched were her lips, so impotent her tongue.</p>
<p>Her ordeal confronted her; no human power could eliminate it
now. To her was the disentangling of knotted threads, the sorting
of the colors in the scheme of things. She averted her face from
Blake as they mounted the Escalier de Sainte-Marie, and her hand
clung for support to the iron railing.</p>
<p>Familiar to the point of agony was the open doorway, the dark
hall of the house in the rue M&uuml;ller. Side by side they
entered; side by side, and in complete silence, they made the
ascent of the stairs, each step of which was heavy with
memories.</p>
<p>On the fifth floor she went forward and opened the door of Max's
<i>appartement</i>. Within, all was dark and quiet, and Blake,
loyally following her, passed without comment through the tiny
hall, on into the little <i>salon</i> where the light from the
brilliant sky made visible the pathetically familiar
objects&mdash;the old copper vessels, the dower chest, the leathern
arm-chair.</p>
<p>This leather chair stood like a faithful sentinel close to the
open window, and as his eyes rested on it he was conscious of a
pained contraction of the heart, for it stood exactly where it had
stood when last he watched the stars and rambled through his dreams
and ideals, with the boy for listener. The thought came quick and
sharp, goading him as many a puzzled thought had goaded him in his
months of solitude, and as at Versailles, he turned to Maxine, a
question on his lips.</p>
<p>But again she checked that question. Stepping through the
shadows, she drew him across the room toward the window. Reaching
the old chair, she touched his shoulder, gently compelling him to
sit down.</p>
<p>"Ned," she said, and to her own ears the word sounded infinitely
far away. "I seem to you very mad. But you have a great patience.
Will you be patient a little longer?"</p>
<p>She had withdrawn behind the chair, laying both her hands upon
his shoulders, and as she spoke her voice shook in an unconquerable
nervousness, her whole body shook.</p>
<p>"My sweet!" He turned quickly and looked up at her. "What is all
this? Why are you torturing yourself? For God's sake, let us be
frank with each other&mdash;"</p>
<p>But she pressed his shoulders convulsively. "Wait! wait! It is
only a little moment now. I implore you to wait!"</p>
<p>He sank back, and as in a dream felt her fingers release their
hold and heard her move gently back across the room; then,
overwhelmed by the burden of dread that oppressed him, he leaned
forward, bowing his face upon his hands.</p>
<p>Minutes passed&mdash;how few, how many, he made no attempt to
reckon&mdash;then again the hushed steps sounded behind him, the
sense of a gracious presence made itself felt.</p>
<p>Instinctively he attempted to rise, but, as before, Maxine's
hands were laid upon his shoulders, pressing him back into his
seat. He saw her hands in the starlight&mdash;saw the glint of his
own ring.</p>
<p>"Ned!"</p>
<p>"Dear one?"</p>
<p>"It is dim, here in this room, but you know me? Your soul sees
me?" Her voice was shaking, her words sobbed like notes upon an
instrument strung to breaking pitch.</p>
<p>"My dear one! My dear one!" His voice, too, was sharp and
pained; he strove to turn in his chair, but she restrained him.</p>
<p>"No! No! Say it without looking. You know me? I am Maxine?"</p>
<p>"Of course you are Maxine!"</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>It was a short, swift sound like the sobbing breath of a spent
runner. It spoke a thousand things, and with its vibrations
trembling upon her lips, Maxine came round the chair and Blake,
looking up, saw Max&mdash;Max of old, Max of the careless clothes,
the clipped waving locks.</p>
<p>It is in moments grotesque or supreme that men show themselves.
He sprang to his feet; he stared at the apparition until his eyes
grew wide, but all he said was 'God!' very softly to himself.
'God!' And then again, 'God!'</p>
<p>It was Maxine who opened the flood-gates of emotion; Maxine who,
with wild gesture and broken voice, dressed the situation in
words.</p>
<p>"Now it is over! Now it is finished&mdash;the whole foolish
play! Now you have your sight&mdash;and your liberty to hate me!
Hate me! Hate me! I am waiting."</p>
<p>"God!" whispered Blake again, not hearing her, piecing his
thoughts together as a waking man tries to piece a dream.
'God!'</p>
<p>The reiteration tortured her. She suddenly caught his arm,
forcing him into contact with her. "Do not speak to yourself!" she
cried. "Speak to me! Say all you think! Hate me! Hate me!"</p>
<p>Then at last he broke through the confusion of his mind,
startling her as such men will always startle women by their innate
singleness of thought.</p>
<p>"Hate you?" he said. "Why, in God's name, should I hate
you?"</p>
<p>"Because it is right and just."</p>
<p>"That I should hate you, because I have been a fool? I do not
see that."</p>
<p>"But, Ned!" she cried; then, suddenly, at its sharpest, her
voice broke; she threw herself upon her knees beside the chair and
sobbed.</p>
<p>And then it was that Blake showed himself. Kneeling down beside
her, he put both arms about the boyish figure and, holding it
close, poured forth&mdash;not questions, not reproaches, not
protestations&mdash;but a stream of compassion.</p>
<p>"Poor child! Poor child! Poor child! What a fool I've been! What
a brute I've been!"</p>
<p>But Maxine sobbed passionately, shrinking away from him, as
though his touch were pain.</p>
<p>"My child! My child! How foolish I have been! But how foolish
you have been, too&mdash;how sweetly foolish! You gave with one
hand and took away with the other. But now it is all over. Now you
are going to give with both hands&mdash;- I am to have my friend
and my love as well. It is very wonderful. Oh, sweet, don't fret!
Don't fret! See how simple it all is!"</p>
<p>But Maxine's bitter crying went on, until at last it frightened
him.</p>
<p>"Maxine, don't! Don't, for God's sake! Why should you cry like
this? What is it, when all's said and done, but a point of view?
And a point of view is adjusted much more quickly than you think.
At first I thought the earth was reeling round me, but now I know
that 'twas only my own brain that reeled; and I know, too, that
subconsciously I must always have recognized you in Max&mdash;for I
never treated Max as a common boy, did I? Did I, now? I always had
a queer&mdash;a queer respect for him. Dear one, see it with me!
Try to see it with me?"</p>
<p>His appeal was pathetic; it was he who was the culprit&mdash;he
who extenuated and pleaded. The position struck Maxine, wounding
her like a knife.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't!" she cried in her own turn. "Don't, for the sake of
God!"</p>
<p>"But why? Why? My sweet! My love! My little friend!
Max&mdash;Maxine!"</p>
<p>It was not to be borne. She wrenched herself free and sprang to
her feet, confronting him with a pale face down which the tears
streamed.</p>
<p>"Because I am not your love! I am not your friend! I am not your
Max&mdash;or your Maxine!"</p>
<p>Swift as she, he was on his feet, his bearing changed, his
manhood recognizing the challenge in her voice, his instinct of
possession alive to combat it.</p>
<p>"Not mine?" he said; and to Maxine, standing white and frail
before him, the words seemed to have all the significance of life
itself. Now at last they confronted each other&mdash;man and woman;
now at last the issue in the war of sex was to be put to the
test.</p>
<p>She had always known that this moment would arrive&mdash;always
known that she would meet it in some such manner as she was meeting
it now.</p>
<p>"Not mine?" Blake said again.</p>
<p>She shook her head, throwing back her shoulders, clasping her
hands behind her, unconsciously taking on the attitude of
defiance.</p>
<p>"And why not?"</p>
<p>It was curt, this question, as man's vital questions ever are;
it was an onslaught that clove to the heart of things.</p>
<p>She trembled for an instant, then met his eyes.</p>
<p>"Because I will belong to no one. I must possess myself."</p>
<p>He stared at her.</p>
<p>"But it is not given to any one to possess himself! How can you
separate an atom from the universal mass?"</p>
<p>"An atom may detach itself&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And fall into space! Is that self-possession? But, my God, are
we going to split hairs? Maxine! Maxine!" He came close to her and
put out his arms, but with a fierce gesture she evaded him; then,
as swiftly, caught his hand.</p>
<p>"Oh, Ned! Oh, Ned! Can't you see?"</p>
<p>"No!" said Blake, simply. "I cannot."</p>
<p>"Listen! Then listen! I know myself for an individual&mdash;for
a definite entity; I know that here&mdash;here, within
me"&mdash;she struck her breast&mdash;"I have power&mdash;power to
think&mdash;power to achieve. And how do you think that power is to
be developed?" She paused, looking at him with burning eyes. "Not
by the giving of my soul into bondage&mdash;not by the submerging
of myself in another being. That night in Petersburg I saw my
way&mdash;the hard way, the lonely way! Oh, Ned!" She stopped
again, searching his face, but his face was pale and
immobile&mdash;curiously, unnaturally immobile.</p>
<p>With a passionate gesture, she flung his hand from her. "Oh, it
is so cruel! Can't you see? Can't you understand? I left Russia to
make a new life; I made myself a man, not for a whim, but as a
symbol. Sex is only an accident, but the world has made man the
independent creature&mdash;and I desired independence. Sex is only
an accident. Mentally, I am as good a man as you are."</p>
<p>"Ten times a better man," said Blake, startingly. "But not near
so good a woman. For I know the highest thing&mdash;and you do
not."</p>
<p>"The highest thing?"</p>
<p>"Love."</p>
<p>"Ah!" She threw up her hands in despair and walked to the
window, looking up blankly at the stars. Then, suddenly, she spoke
again, tossing her words back into the room.</p>
<p>"I suppose you think I am happy in all this?"</p>
<p>He was silent.</p>
<p>"I suppose you think I find this heaven?"</p>
<p>At last he answered. He came across to her; he stood looking at
her with his strange new expression of inscrutability.</p>
<p>"Oh, Maxine!" he said, "why must you misjudge me? Little Maxine,
who could be taken in my arms this minute and carried away to my
castle, like a princess of long ago&mdash;but who would break her
heart over the bondage! I haven't much, dear one, to justify my
existence&mdash;but the gods have given me intuition. I do not
think you are in heaven."</p>
<p>He waited a moment, while in the sky above them the stars looked
down impartially upon the white domes of the church and the beacons
of pleasure in the city below.</p>
<p>"Maxine! Shall I say the things for you that you want to
say?"</p>
<p>She bent her head.</p>
<p>"Well, first of all, God help us, the world is a terrible
tangle; and then you have a strange soul that has never yet half
revealed itself. You sent me away from you because you feared love;
you called me back because you feared your fear&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No! No! You are reasoning now, not justifying! You are
entrapping me!"</p>
<p>"Am I?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and I refuse to be entrapped! I know love&mdash;I know all
the specious things that love can say; the talk of independence,
the talk of equality! But I know the reality, too. The reality is
the absolute annihilation of the woman&mdash;the absolute merging
of her identity."</p>
<p>"So that is love?"</p>
<p>"That is love."</p>
<p>He stood looking at her with a long profound look of deep
restraint, of great sadness.</p>
<p>"Maxine," he said, at last, "you have many gifts&mdash;a high
intelligence, a young body, a strong soul, but in the matter of
love you are a little child. To you, love is barter and exchange;
but love is not that. Love is nothing but a giving&mdash;an
exhaustless giving of one's very best."</p>
<p>She tried to laugh. "I understand! I should give!"</p>
<p>"No, sweet, you should not. You cannot know the privileges of
love, for you do not know love."</p>
<p>"Oh, Ned! How cruel! How cruel!"</p>
<p>"You do not know love," he spoke, very gently, without any
bitterness, "and I do know it; for it has grown in me, day by day,
in these long months away from you. I am not to be praised, any
more than you are to be blamed. But I do love you&mdash;with my
heart and my soul&mdash;with my life and my strength. I would die
for you, if dying would help you; and as it won't, I will do the
harder thing&mdash;live for you."</p>
<p>Her lips were parted, but they uttered no sound; her eyes, dark
with thought, searched his face.</p>
<p>"Oh, Maxine!" He caught her hand. "How low you have rated
me&mdash;to think I would wrest you from yourself! Is it my place
to make life harder for you?"</p>
<p>Still she gazed at him. "I do not understand," she said, in a
frightened whisper.</p>
<p>"Never mind, sweet! It doesn't matter if you never understand.
Just give me credit for one saving grace."</p>
<p>He spoke lightly, as men speak when they are bankrupt of hope,
then with a sudden breaking of his stoicism, he caught her in his
arms, straining her close, kissing her mouth, talking incoherently
to himself.</p>
<p>"Oh, Maxine! Little faun of the green groves! If you could know!
But what am I that I should possess the kingdom of heaven?"</p>
<p>His ecstasy frightened her; she struggled to free herself.</p>
<p>"What is it?" she asked. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"Just love&mdash;no more, no less! Good-bye! Take your
life&mdash;make it what you will; but know always that one man at
least has seen heaven in your eyes." Again he held her to him, his
whole life seeming to flow out upon his thoughts and to envelop
her, then his arms relaxed and very soberly he took, first one of
her hands, and then the other, kissing each in turn.</p>
<p>"Maxine!"</p>
<p>"Ned!" The word faltered on her lips.</p>
<p>"That's right!" he whispered. "I only wanted you to say my name.
Good-bye now! Don't fret for me! After all, everything is as it
should be."</p>
<p>She stood before him, the conqueror. All preconceptions had been
scattered; she had not even won her laurels, they had been placed
at her feet; and all the pomp and circumstance she could summon to
her triumphing was a white face, a drooping head, and speechless
lips.</p>
<p>"Good-bye, Maxine!" The words cried for response, and by a
supreme effort she summoned her voice from some far region.</p>
<p>"Good-bye!"</p>
<p>He did not kiss her hand again, but bending his head, he
solemnly kissed his own ring, lying cold upon her finger.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XLI'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XLI</h2>
<br>
<div class="first">ALL was finished. Mystery was at an end. The
pilgrim's staff had been placed in Maxine's hand, her feet set
toward the great white road. She leaned back against the window of
the <i>salon</i> and her mental eyes scanned that road&mdash;the
coveted road of freedom, the way of splendid isolation&mdash;and in
a vague, dumb fashion she wondered why the whiteness that had
gleamed like snow in the distance should take on the hue of dust
seen at close quarters. She wondered why she should feel so
absolutely numbed&mdash;why life, with its exuberances of joy and
sorrow, should suddenly have receded from her as a tide
recedes.</div>
<p>There had been no battle; hers was a bloodless victory. Fate had
been exquisitely kind, as is Fate's way when she would be ironical.
Maxine could call up no cause for grief or for resentment, no cause
even for remorse. She had confessed herself; she had been shriven
and blessed, and bade to go her way!</p>
<p>Passing in review these phantom speculations, her eyes suddenly
refused the vision of the mythical white road, stretching away in
brain-sickening length, and her physical sight caught at the
familiar picture revealed by the balcony&mdash;the thrice-known,
thrice-loved shrubbery, where already the glossy holly leaves were
stirring under September's fingers, whispering one to the other of
fine cold autumn hours when gales would sweep the heights, bringing
death to their frailer brethren, while they themselves nestled snug
and strong, laughing at the elements. She traced the familiar
outline of these sturdy bushes, and her perfect triumph seemed like
a winding sheet about her limbs. She was above the world, removed
from care, and all she knew was that she would have given her heart
for one moment of the hot human grief that had seared her not four
months ago.</p>
<p>She turned from the trees, turned from the stars and moved back
into the unlighted room. All was quiet and dim; she stumbled
against the arm-chair and recoiled as though a friend had touched
her inopportunely; then she passed blindly onward, finding the
little hall, finding the outer door with groping hands.</p>
<p>Outside was a deeper darkness, for here no starlight penetrated;
but M. Cartel's door was ajar, and through the opening came a
streak of lamplight and the hum of voices.</p>
<p>Pausing, Maxine caught the deep, humorous tones of M. Cartel
himself, broken first by an unknown voice, quick, tense, typically
Parisian, then by the light laugh of Jacqueline.</p>
<p>In her cruel perfection of triumph, she had no need to fear
these voices&mdash;these little evidences of sociability. They
could not hurt her, for was she not impervious to pain?</p>
<p>Another laugh, full and contented, came to her ear, then the
opening of the piano and the masterful striking of a chord.</p>
<p>A murmur of pleasure gave evidence of an audience, and
instinctively she moved forward, as a wanderer on a dark night
draws near to a lighted dwelling. Gaining the door, she softly
pushed it open, as M. Cartel executed a <i>roulade</i>, which
melted into a brilliant piece of improvization.</p>
<p>A bright lamp shone in the hall; but beyond, the open door of
the living-room displayed a half-lighted interior, with a handful
of people grouped about it. Foremost figure was M. Cartel seated at
his music within a radius of yellow light shed by four candles,
while, beside him, a tall thin boy, and, behind him, Jacqueline
seemed enclosed in a secondary, fainter circle of luminance. The
rest of the room was in shadow, and as Maxine entered, she scarcely
noticed the three other occupants&mdash;two men and a
woman&mdash;who sat in a row close to the door, their backs to the
wall.</p>
<p>No one commented upon her entry. The little Jacqueline glanced
round once, smiling a quick welcome, but returned immediately to
her contemplation of M. Cartel; the younger of the two men by the
door&mdash;an Italian&mdash;paused in the lighting of a cigarette,
but his companion&mdash;an old Polish Jew with a classic head and
long, gray beard&mdash;retained his attitude of rapt attention,
while the woman, who sat a little apart, and whose large black hat
hid her face, made no sign.</p>
<p>Treading softly, Maxine entered and crept into a seat opposite
the trio, realizing, with an indifference that surprised her, that
the woman was Lize of the Bal Tabarin and the Caf&eacute; des
Cerises-jumelles.</p>
<p>The music poured forth, a glittering stream of sound. The young
Italian lighted cigarette after cigarette, smoking furiously and
beating soundless time upon the floor with his foot, the old Pole
sat lost in an emotional dream, tears gathering slowly in his eyes
and trickling unheeded down his cheeks, while Lize, in her moveless
isolation, gazed with fixed intensity at the wall above Maxine's
head.</p>
<p>Time passed; time seemed of small account in that
atmosphere&mdash;as the outside world was of small account. Not one
of the little audience questioned how the other lived. It mattered
nothing that in other hours the artistic fingers of the young
Italian were employed in the manufacture of fraudulent
antiques&mdash;that the enthusiast by the piano wrote humorous
songs at a starvation wage for an unsuccessful
<i>comique</i>&mdash;that Lize, finding humanity foolish, made
profit of its folly! 'What would you?' they would have asked with a
shrug. 'One must live!' For the rest, there were moments such as
this&mdash;moments when the artist was paramount in each of
them&mdash;when pure enthusiasm made them children again!</p>
<p>M. Cartel played on. He had forsaken improvization now, and was
interpreting magnificently; occasionally the boy by the piano threw
up his hands ecstatically, muttering incoherently to himself;
occasionally the young Italian broke silence by a sharp,
irresistible '<i>Brava</i>'; but for the most part respectful
silence spoke the intensity of the spell.</p>
<p>Then at last Maxine, sitting in her corner, saw Jacqueline bend
over the shoulder of M. Cartel, her hair shining like sun-rays in
the candlelight&mdash;saw her whisper in his ear&mdash;saw him look
up and nod in abrupt acquiescence, and saw his square-tipped
fingers lift for an instant from the keys and descend again to a
series of new chords.</p>
<p>A little murmur of interest passed over the listeners. The
Italian threw away his half-smoked cigarette and lighted another,
the Pole smiled tolerantly with half-closed eyes, as the old smile
at the vagaries of the young, and Maxine in her shadowed seat felt
her heart leap tumultuously as the little Jacqueline, her arm
na&iuml;vely round the shoulder of M. Cartel, her head thrown back,
began to sing the first lines of the duet in <i>Louise</i>:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span>'Depuis le jour o&ugrave; je me suis
donn&eacute;e, toute fleurie semble ma destin&eacute;e.<br></span>
<span>Je crois r&ecirc;ver sous un ciel de f&eacute;erie,
l'&acirc;me encore gris&eacute;e de ton premier
baiser!'<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>And M. Cartel, lifting his head, broke in with the single
electric cry of Julian the lover:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span>'Louise!'<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>Then, as if answering to the personal note, Jacqueline melted
into Louise's sweet admission of absolute surrender:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span>'Quelle belle vie!<br></span> <span>Ah,
je suis heureuse! trop heureuse ... et je tremble
d&eacute;licieusement,<br></span> <span>Au souvenir charmant du
premier jour d'amour!'<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>The effect was instant. The youth by the piano smiled radiantly
and nodded in vehement approval; the young Italian puffed fiercely
at his cigarette; a flash of light crossed Lize's gaze, causing it
to concentrate.</p>
<p>Jacqueline had no extraordinary voice, but music was native to
her, and she sang as birds sing, with a true light sweetness
exquisite to the ear:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span>'Souvenir charmant du premier jour
d'amour!'<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>The declaration came to the listeners with a pure sincerity, it
abounded in simplicity, in youthfulness, in conviction. A quiver
ran through Maxine, her numbed senses vibrated. By an acute
intuition she realized the composer's meaning; more, she
appreciated the thrill called up in the soul of M. Cartel. Her ears
were strained to catch each note, each phrase, with an intentness
that astonished her; it suddenly appeared that out of all the
world, one thing alone was of significance&mdash;the close
following of this song, the apprehending of its purpose.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span>'Souvenir charmant du premier jour
d'amour!'<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>The first night with Blake upon the balcony sprang back to
memory, and with it the wonder, the delight, the illimitable sense
of kinship with the universe. Again the spiritual sense lived in
her, not warring with the physical, but justifying, completing it.
She sat upright against the wall, suddenly fearful of this
overwhelming mental disturbance&mdash;fighting the cloud of memory
almost as one fights a bodily faintness.</p>
<p>The music grew in meaning; she heard Julian's ardent
question:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span>'Tu ne regrette rien?'<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>and Louise's triumphant answer:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span>'Rien!'<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>The words, simply human, divinely just, assailed her ears, and
by light of the intuition&mdash;the superconsciousness that was
dominating her&mdash;the whole truth of this confessed love poured
in upon her soul. She saw the halo about the head of the little
singer, she appreciated the sublime giving of herself that cried in
the music of the song. It was no mere sentiment on the lips of this
fair child, it was the proclamation of a tremendous fact.</p>
<p>She leaned back against the wall, lips set, hands clasped. She
clung to the rock of her theories like a drowning man, and like the
drowning man she realized the imminence of the inundation that
threatened her.</p>
<p>The music swelled, and now it was not Jacqueline alone who sang;
M. Cartel's voice rose, completing, perfecting the higher feminine
notes, blending with them as the music of wind or running water
might harmonize with the singing of a bird. It was not art but
nature that was at work in the words:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class="stanza"><span>'Nous sommes tous les amants,
fid&egrave;les a leur serment! Ah, le divin roman!<br></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span>Nous sommes toutes les &acirc;mes que
br&ucirc;le le sainte flamme du d&eacute;sire!<br></span>
<span class='i2'>Ah, la parole id&eacute;ale dont s'enivre mon
corps tout entier!<br></span> <span class='i2'>Dis encore ta
chanson de d&eacute;lice! Ta chanson victorieuse, ta chanson de
printemps!'<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>The duet wore on, enthralling in its closeness to common human
life, with its touches of tears, its touches of laughter, its hints
of tenderness and bursts of passion. Not one face but had softened
in comprehension as Louise painted the picture of her home&mdash;of
the gentle father, the scolding mother, the little daily frictions
that wear patience thin; not one heart but had leaped when passion
broke a way through the song, mounting, mounting as upon wings,
until Louise in her ecstasy of love and joy and incredulity
exclaims:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span>'C'est le paradis! C'est une
f&eacute;erie!'<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>And Julian answers:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span>'Non! C'est la vie! l'Eternelle, la toute
puissante vie!'<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>It was the supreme, the psychological moment! The duet
continued, but Maxine heard no further words. They echoed and
re-echoed in her brain, they obsessed her, lifting her to a
sublimal state.</p>
<p>Across the room she saw the Italian throw away his cigarette and
forget to replace it; she saw Lize lean forward breathlessly, and
she knew that in fancy she was back in the Quartier Latin when life
was young&mdash;when love laughed, and her hair was wreathed with
vine leaves. She saw her at last as a living woman&mdash;felt the
grape-juice run down her neck&mdash;felt the kisses of the Jacque
Aujet who was ten years dead!</p>
<p>This, then, was the sum of life! Not the holding of fair things,
but the giving of them!</p>
<p>She rose up; her limbs shook, but she paid no heed to physical
strength or weakness; she was on a plane where the soul moved free,
regardless of mortal needs. Neither Max nor Maxine had any place in
her conceptions. She saw Lize, broken but justified, because she
had given when life asked of her; she saw the little Jacqueline,
with the halo of candle-light turning her blonde hair to gold; in a
distant dream she saw the frail, steadfast Madame Salas, and in a
near, poignant vision she saw Blake, and her soul melted within
her.</p>
<p>She conceived the world as one immense censer into which men and
women poured their all, and from which a wondrous white smoke, a
scent incredibly lovely, rose continually, enveloping the
universe.</p>
<p>To give! To give without hope of recompense, without question,
without fear! That was the message of life.</p>
<p>She looked round the little room; she yearned to put out her
arms, to clasp each hand, to touch each forehead with the kiss of
living fellowship. Love consumed her, humility rilled her, she was
a child again, with all things to learn.</p>
<p>The music was reaching its climax, it was filling every corner
of the room, and as she glanced toward the piano in a last long
look, the two voices rose in unison.</p>
<p>Silently&mdash;none knowing the revolution within her
soul&mdash;none seeing the heights upon which she
walked&mdash;Maxine moved to the door and slipped out into the
hall, the picture of the lovers before her eyes, in her ears the
symbolic cry:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span>'C'est la vie! l'Eternelle, la toute
puissante vie!'<br></span></div>
</div>
<p>Like a being inspired, she passed back into her own
<i>appartement</i>, and there, with a strange high excitement that
was yet mystically calm, entered her little bedroom and lighted
candles until not a shadow was left in all the white circumscribed
space; then, standing in the illumination, like an acolyte who
ministers to some secret rite, she slowly unburdened herself of her
boy's garments.</p>
<p>The task was brief; they fell from her lightly, leaving her fair
and virginal and untrammelled in body, as she was virginal and
untrammelled in mind; and with a sweet gravity she clothed herself,
garment by garment, in the dress of the morning.</p>
<p>Ardent and eager&mdash;yet restrained, as befitted a woman aware
of her high place&mdash;she left the room and passed down the
Escalier de Sainte-Marie. A rush of cool air came to her across the
plantation, kissing her hot cheeks, the holly bushes whispered
their secrets&mdash;which were her secrets as well, the eyes of the
stars looked down, smiling into her eyes. She observed no face in
the thronging faces that passed her; she made her steadfast way to
the one point in the universe that was her goal by right divine.
Even in the hallway of Blake's house she did not stop to question,
but mounted the stairs and knocked upon his door, regardless of the
stormy beating of her heart, the faintness of anticipation that
encompassed her.</p>
<p>A moment passed&mdash;a moment or a century; then he was before
her, appealing to the innermost recesses of her being.</p>
<p>He stared at her, as one might stare upon a ghost.</p>
<p>"Maxine!"</p>
<p>Her lips parted, trembling with a pleading tenderness.</p>
<p>"Maxine!" he said again; and now his voice shook, as hers had
shaken in Max's little starlit studio.</p>
<p>It was the cry she had waited for&mdash;the confirmation of her
faith. Her hands went out to him; her soul suddenly poured forth
allegiance in look and voice.</p>
<p>"Ned! Ned! Take me! Take me and teach me! Take me away to your
castle, like the princess of old. Show me the white sky and the
opal sea, and the seaweed that smells like violets!"</p>
<p>His hands clasped hers, his incredulous eyes besought her.
"Maxine, this is some dream?"</p>
<p>"No; it is no dream. We are awake. It is life!"</p>
<br>
<p>THE END</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
